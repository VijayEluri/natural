   Sun Microsystems Inc. said it will post a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss of as much as $26 million and may show a loss in the current first quarter, raising further troubling questions about the once high-flying computer workstation maker.

   Sun reported last month that management errors, rather than a weakness in the market for computer workstations, would result in lower earnings or a "slight loss" in the quarter ended June 30.
But the amount cited in yesterday's disclosure was far greater than analysts had suspected, and suggested deepening troubles.

   "It is extremely disconcerting," said Peter Rogers, computer analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. in San Francisco.
"Many of us had been led to believe that most (of the management-systems problems) had been put behind them.
It looks like there is another layer."

   "On the surface, it would lead one to conclude that Sun has at least temporarily completely lost control of its operations," Mr. Rogers added.

   The maker of high-performance desktop computers now says the loss was probably between $20 million and $26 million, compared with year-ago net income of $25.3 million, or 66 cents a share.

   The huge fourth-quarter loss will bring year-end earnings to between $55 million and $61 million, or between 72 cents and 78 cents a share, compared with year-ago net of $66.4 million, or 89 cents a share.

   Sun said it expects to report fourth-quarter revenue of $425 million to $435 million, up 16% to 19% from a year earlier.
That would contrast sharply with Sun's third quarter, when revenue surged 92%, and would put full-year revenue in the $1.75 billion to $1.77 billion range, up from $1.05 billion a year earlier.

   Sun said the problems that led to the loss have "largely been resolved," and that it received record bookings in its fourth quarter.
Still, Sun said profitability in the current quarter, ending Sept. 30, can't be assured.
The company added that a return to profitability will depend on the effectiveness of cost-cutting measures and its ability to obtain parts.
A spokeswoman said the company still faces a shortage of certain parts.

   In June, Sun said operations were disrupted by a change to a new system for getting information to management.
The company also cited faulty forecasting of demand, problems in manufacturing new machines and a shortage of certain parts.
The spokeswoman reiterated that the company sees strong demand for its products, and believes the market for computer workstations remains healthy.

   Sun said it has imposed a hiring freeze in all areas except sales and customer service, postponed moving into new facilities and curtailed other expenses.
The spokeswoman wouldn't say how much the cost-cutting measures will save.

   The announcement was made after the market closed.
Sun's stock closed at $16.25, up 62.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.
