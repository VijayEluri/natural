   Sun Microsystems Inc. said it will post a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss of as much as $26 million and may show a loss in the current first quarter, raising further troubling questions about the once high-flying computer workstation maker.

   Sun reported last month that management errors, rather than a weakness in the market for computer workstations, would result in lower earnings or a "slight loss" in the quarter ended June 30.
But the amount cited in yesterday's disclosure was far greater than analysts had suspected, and suggested deepening troubles.

   "It is extremely disconcerting," said Peter Rogers, computer analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. in San Francisco.
"Many of us had been led to believe that most (of the management-systems problems) had been put behind them.
It looks like there is another layer."

   "On the surface, it would lead one to conclude that Sun has at least temporarily completely lost control of its operations," Mr. Rogers added.

   The maker of high-performance desktop computers now says the loss was probably between $20 million and $26 million, compared with year-ago net income of $25.3 million, or 66 cents a share.

   The huge fourth-quarter loss will bring year-end earnings to between $55 million and $61 million, or between 72 cents and 78 cents a share, compared with year-ago net of $66.4 million, or 89 cents a share.

   Sun said it expects to report fourth-quarter revenue of $425 million to $435 million, up 16% to 19% from a year earlier.
That would contrast sharply with Sun's third quarter, when revenue surged 92%, and would put full-year revenue in the $1.75 billion to $1.77 billion range, up from $1.05 billion a year earlier.

   Sun said the problems that led to the loss have "largely been resolved," and that it received record bookings in its fourth quarter.
Still, Sun said profitability in the current quarter, ending Sept. 30, can't be assured.
The company added that a return to profitability will depend on the effectiveness of cost-cutting measures and its ability to obtain parts.
A spokeswoman said the company still faces a shortage of certain parts.

   In June, Sun said operations were disrupted by a change to a new system for getting information to management.
The company also cited faulty forecasting of demand, problems in manufacturing new machines and a shortage of certain parts.
The spokeswoman reiterated that the company sees strong demand for its products, and believes the market for computer workstations remains healthy.

   Sun said it has imposed a hiring freeze in all areas except sales and customer service, postponed moving into new facilities and curtailed other expenses.
The spokeswoman wouldn't say how much the cost-cutting measures will save.

   The announcement was made after the market closed.
Sun's stock closed at $16.25, up 62.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.

   Bush administration efforts to kill production of Grumman Corp.'s F-14 jet fighters collapsed in the House, as Republican leaders surprisingly decided to abandon the fight at the last minute.

   The House, approving a $305 billion defense authorization bill, dealt President Bush a second setback by rejecting his proposal for simultaneous development of two mobile-missile systems.
By supporting both the nuclear-tipped Midgetman and the larger, multiple-warhead MX placed on special railroad cars, the White House had hoped to forge a bipartisan coalition to break a legislative impasse over upgrading U.S. land-based missiles.

   But the fragile compromise fell apart moments before final passage, stripping the measure of funds to begin deployment of either option.
Liberal Democrats opposed to Midgetman, and Republicans -- many of whom felt betrayed by earlier moves to slash MX funding -- managed to gut the White House strategy by approving a final amendment on a procedural 176-90 vote.

   Despite an emotional plea by Armed Services Committee chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) that the gambit would "blow everything up at the end," the revised bill passed by a 261-162 vote.
By cutting deeply money requested for the two missiles, the B-2 Stealth bomber and a proposed space-based anti-missile shield, Rep. Aspin said after the vote that the House bill "pretty well shredded George Bush's strategic programs."

   The House's position on land-based missiles and the Navy's F-14 jets conflict with the version of the bill taking shape in the Senate, setting the stage for prolonged negotiations to work out the differences.

   In a shift that caught many of his allies flat-footed, Rep. William Dickinson (R., Ala.), the administration's point man to kill Grumman's F-14, opted to withdraw an amendment seeking to shut down the production line on Long Island.
The decision came in the face of strong bipartisan support for the embattled F-14.

   Capping months of intense lobbying by Grumman and its supporters, Rep. Dickinson's move kept about $1 billion to continue F-14 production in the bill.

   Rep. Dickinson also agreed to withdraw a separate amendment to kill the V-22, a planned $25 billion Marine Corps troop transport opposed by the administration.
The tilt-rotor aircraft, designed to take off like a helicopter but cruise like a plane, is being developed by units of Boeing Co. and Textron Inc.

   While providing a big boost for Grumman and its embattled carrier-based fighter, yesterday's moves were a major political setback -- as well as a bitter personal defeat -- for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.

   Almost from the moment he became defense chief four months ago, Mr. Cheney, a former Republican House leader, has staked his reputation and much of his political goodwill on trying to persuade Congress to scuttle the F-14 and other programs for budget reasons.
He also has worked hard to convince Congress that putting money into both mobile missiles gives U.S. arms-control negotiatiors maximum flexibility.

   As the ranking GOP member of the Armed Services Commitee, Rep. Dickinson was his chief ally in both fights.

   But after a series of meetings Wednesday night and yesterday morning with Grumman supporters -- including Republican lawmakers from New York and Florida -- Rep. Dickinson had a change of heart.
He apparently concluded that his F-14 and V-22 amendments would be resoundingly defeated, and after consulting with Mr. Cheney and other senior House Republicans he decided to avoid a showdown.

   In the Senate, Mr. Bush couldn't avoid a showdown over an amendment to cut $500 million from the proposed anti-missile shield, called the Strategic Defense Initiative.
But with Vice President Quayle presiding in case of a tie vote, the Senate voted 50-47 to support the administration and retain $4.5 billion for SDI.

   Tokyo stocks closed higher in healthy trading, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues climbing to a record.

   London share prices ended sharply higher as the market drew inspiration from a firm pound, a robust performance on Wall Street, and a renewal of speculative buying interest.

   In Tokyo, the Nikkei was up 269.45 points at 34785.28, breaking the record of 34538.90 set Tuesday.

   In midmorning trading Friday, the Nikkei index was up 42.91 points to 34828.19.

   Positive external market factors bolstered bullishness in the market Thursday.
The "triple merits" of lower oil prices, a stronger yen and the prospect of lower interest rates resulting from an easing of monetary policy in the U.S. brought institutional and individual investors into the market, brokers said.

   The allocation of investment trust fund money through the week will help sustain the market rally, according to observers.

   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.30 billion shares, up from 1.07 billion shares Wednesday.

   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 591 to 332, and 173 issues were unchanged.

   Market movement Wednesday set up a favorable environment for anticipated heavy trading Thursday, the first trading day for August settlement.
"Wednesday was exactly what we needed.
The market went too high and came back in the afternoon to put us back on track for today," said one trader.

   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which gained 2.06 points Wednesday, was up 19.35 points at 2605.48.

   Positive fundamental factors helped stimulate active trading by investors.
Large institutional investors had been sidelined for the last couple of months waiting for the results of Sunday's upper house election.

   The broad rally in the market included many sectors that have lagged because of recent market sluggishness.
Among them are pharmaceuticals, life insurance, railroads, electric power and real estate.

   Big buying orders by one of the "big four" brokerage firms for pharmaceuticals started that sector rolling, a trader said.Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals was up 70 yen (50 cents) at 3,800 yen ($27.11).
Mochida Pharmaceuticals was up 90 yen at 3,640.

   In the nonlife insurance sector, Taisho Marine was up 60 yen at 1,540, and Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine was up 60 yen at 1,520.

   Railroad and real estate issues also showed strength.
Tokyu gained 90 yen to 1,850, Keisei Electric Rail rose 150 yen to 2,650 and Keihin Electric Express Railway was up 60 yen at 1,720.
Mitsui Real Estate rose 100 yen to 2,710, and Heiwa Real Estate gained 30 yen to 2,050.

   Meanwhile, in London, dealers also attributed a portion of the day's sharp gain to the actions of market makers, who interpreted the market's positive sentiment as an excuse to mark prices higher.

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 19.2 points firmer at 2283.7 points, after touching a high for the day of 2287.4.
At its lowest, the index stood at 2274.2.

   "The strong pound again revived hopes that the next move in U.K. interest rates will be downward," one trader noted.

   At the close, the narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 16.7 points at 1902.5.
Turnover at the close was a mediocre 481.3 million shares, up from 333.2 million Wednesday.

   At the London close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.73 points at 2621.78.
Glaxo ended 32 pence (53 cents) higher at #14.25 ($23.61), buoyed by news of a merger between U.S. pharmaceutical companies Bristol-Myers and Squibb.
Last week, Glaxo's shares were dented by rumors that it would merge with Squibb.
In sympathy, Amersham rose 8 pence to 490, and Fisons climbed 8 to 338.

   Half-year earnings at Imperial Chemical Industries were largely in line with expectations, but the company reported a #41 million exceptional gain because of disposals and rationalizations that was coolly received by the market.
ICI shares, which gained as much as 21 pence initially, ended just 1 pence higher at #12.55.

   Reuters surged 45 pence to 809 as 2.4 million shares changed hands, reportedly on heavy buying from U.S. institutions.
One Reuters market maker said a presentation Wednesday by Kidder Peabody in the U.S. underpinned the interest.

   "Reuters interim results were strong, and there has been follow-through buying all week," a trader noted.

   A number of the market's favorite speculative stocks also posted gains Thursday.
Reckitt &amp; Colman rose 18 pence to 1214, B.A.T Industries climbed 11 pence to 888, and Pearson advanced 18 pence to 764.

   In Frankfurt, share prices ended mixed after seesawing throughout the session on bouts of profit-taking and renewed buying.
Stocks in Paris closed higher in active trading on signs of easier U.S. interest rates.
Brokers gave U.S. markets much of the credit for the advance.

   In Zurich, share prices rose in active trading, driven by aggressive and widespread purchases in the banking and insurance sectors, brokers said.
Share prices in Amsterdam rose to a record, boosted by opening gains on Wall Street, but many issues ended slightly off their highs after a round of profit-taking.

   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Brussels, Stockholm and Milan.
South African gold stocks closed higher.

   In Taipei, the market advanced sharply on relatively active buying.
The Council for Economic Planning and Development forecast economic growth of 7% annually over the next four years.

   In other Asian and Pacific trading, share prices closed higher in Sydney, Manila and Wellington, mixed in Hong Kong and lower in Seoul and Singapore.

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
The percentage change is since year-end.

@  Coffee Futures Prices Extend Their Declines
@  As Producers Continue Their Aggressive Selling

   Coffee futures prices extended their declines as producers continued their aggressive selling of green coffee.

   The September contract ended with a loss of 1.93 cents a pound at 83.44 cents after trading as low as 83.10 cents, a new life-of-contract low.

   Traders were apparently ignoring a meeting on the current market situation scheduled for this weekend in Colombia and involving that nation as well as Brazil and Mexico, according to Arthur Stevenson, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York.

   Coffee prices began to slip significantly June 12, when the September contract fell 6.23 cents a pound and settled below $1.20 as traders began to believe that a new International Coffee Agreement might not be reached.

   When the International Coffee Organization, the agreement's parent body, suspended export quotas early this month, the price drop was accelerated.
More recently, it has slowed but hasn't stopped.
As of yesterday's close, the September contract had fallen 42.54 cents a pound, or 34%, since June 10.

   "It's a deregulated market that's somewhat out of control," said Mr. Stevenson.
"Particularly aggressive sellers have been Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Indonesia.
They have mountains of coffee to sell.
But they're fighting not only to sell coffee, but to increase their market share."

   Mr. Stevenson also said this is the time of year when Brazil's crops are most vulnerable to frost damage, which normally causes cautious selling of coffee by producing countries.

   "But the weather in Brazil has been very stable and mild, and the lack of threatening cold weather has spurred selling by Brazil and others," he said.

   Other price-depressing factors, Mr. Stevenson said, were hedge selling in the futures market by trade firms and by coffee roasters who have bought coffee and want to protect its value against further declines, as well as a weak technical situation.

   When the September price yesterday traded below 83.50 cents to 83.60 cents, selling orders that had been placed there were triggered and helped to depress prices to their low of the day, Mr. Stevenson said.

   A New York coffee importer and dealer said, "Obviously the market hasn't yet found its bottom."

   Some producing countries, he said, continue to push sales of coffee, which in turn is depressing futures prices.

   "I don't see an end to the selling pressure in the immediate future, and a leveling off may not come until roasters begin to buy significant quantities for their winter needs," he said.

   At the moment, roasters aren't eager to buy, he said.
But by late August or early September, that's expected to change.

   As an example of what's available now, the dealer said, Brazilian coffee can be purchased for 73.50 cents a pound and Colombian at 86 cents.
Mexican coffee is offered at 73.50 cents, he said, while Indonesian is available for 49 cents a pound.

   African producers haven't been willing to compete by cutting their prices for Robusta coffee, so Robustas produced by Brazil have been setting the pace in that market at 57.50 cents, the dealer said.
He also said Philippine Robustas can be bought for 39 cents a pound.

   In other commodity markets yesterday:

   SUGAR: Futures prices rose on rumors that India may buy a large quantity of sugar, but late selling trimmed the advance.
The October contract ended with a gain of 0.25 cent a pound at 14.47 cents after trading as high as 14.54 cents.
One dealer cited a wire-service report that India might buy between 300,000 and 500,000 tons of refined sugar for shipment in October.
"When that report hit the floor, prices soared, but they settled back later on," the dealer said.
An analyst, Bernard Savaiko of Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said many countries, some from the Third World, that need sugar but are short of foreign exchange may be hesitating to pay the current high world-market prices.
White sugar is particularly expensive these days, at more than $100 a ton above the price of raw sugar.
"If these countries do buy, it could cause prices to really soar," Mr. Savaiko said.

   ENERGY: Most petroleum futures prices fell again in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery ended the session 18 cents a barrel lower, at $18.12.
Later months were lower as well.
Market observers continued to point to oversupply and weak demand as reasons for the decline -- the fifth in a row.
And most suggested a good likelihood that crude prices might drop more.
Reports of overproduction among Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- particularly Kuwait -- continued to be strong.
Refiners late yesterday were again slashing the price they will pay for WTI.
Several of them lopped another 50 cents off their postings to $17.50 a barrel.
Products were mixed, with gasoline closing higher and heating oil lower.

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices rose moderately, rebounding from recent declines following a government forecast of drier-than-normal weather.
The National Weather Service's 6- to 10-day outlook, released late Wednesday after the market closed, signaled low rainfall in parts of the Western Corn Belt.
Also, some traders felt "we'd had enough on the downside for the time being," said Robert Lekberg, analyst with Farmers Grain &amp; Livestock Corp., Chicago.
However, "I'm not personally convinced that the price slide is over," Mr. Lekberg added, noting that the corn crop is progressing well in many regions.
Rumors circulated that the Soviet Union had made a large purchase of soybeans or soybean meal from Brazil, but they weren't confirmed late in the day.

   Security Pacific Corp., moving to solidify links to a powerful Japanese ally, said it signed a letter of intent to acquire a 20% stake in Mitsui Manufacturers Bank for $38 million.

   Mitsui Manufacturers is a Los Angeles-based unit of Mitsui Bank Ltd., Tokyo, which is the ninth largest bank in the world, with assets of $220 billion.
This is believed to be the first time a U.S. bank has bought into a U.S.-based arm of a Japanese bank.

   Security Pacific, also based in Los Angeles, said Mitsui Bank will work with its Tokyo branch on loan originations, customer referrals and a broad array of other services.
The banking concern also said one of its current executives will be named president and chief operating officer of Mitsui Manufacturers, and Mitsui said some of its senior executives in Japan will work at Security Pacific there.

   Last month, Security Pacific said it had agreed to sell Mitsui 5% of its consumer and commercial services group for $100 million.
A Mitsui unit also is a 50% partner in Security Pacific's commercial finance company in Japan.

   "You don't get married after a couple of dates, but it's obvious that these people are certainly interested in dancing," said George Salem, a banking analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
"Who knows what will develop?"

   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Security Pacific's common closed at $51.50, up $1.125, on trading of 4.2 million shares.
Some of the heavy volume was due to dividend-related activity.

   Security Pacific is the U.S.'s fifth largest banking company, with assets of $85.1 billion.
Robert H. Smith, president, said neither Security Pacific nor Mitsui envisions merging the two institutions and that Security Pacific has no plans to increase its stake in Mitsui Manufacturers.
But he said the companies foresee the evolution of a "global partnership," and it's clear that Security Pacific thinks that is the best way to enter the insular but lucrative Japanese market.

   Mr. Smith said that buying into Mitsui Manufacturers, which has $1.4 billion of assets, will increase Security Pacific's presence in the so-called middle market -- generally, companies that have between $2 million and $25 million in annual sales.
That market has been one of the most consistently profitable in banking in recent years, but Security Pacific only recently began to push into it.

   Security Pacific's developing links with Mitsui prompted speculation that other big U.S. banks may seek Japanese partners.
The world's 10 biggest banks are Japanese, and much of the world's economic growth is coming from the Pacific rim, Mr. Salem said, so "it makes sense to have a Pacific rim partner of that size in a world that's becoming more global and interdependent all the time."

   Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp., two longtime rivals in the pharmaceutical industry, agreed to merge in a stock swap valued at $11.52 billion.

   The companies said the merger would create the world's second-largest drug company, after Merck &amp; Co.
The move is the biggest in a recent flurry of combinations and, because it involves two strong companies, is especially telling of the enormous competitive pressures in the industry world-wide and the staggering cost of turning laboratory discoveries into effective and profitable drugs.

   "The pharmaceutical industry is truly global," said Richard L. Gelb, chairman and chief executive officer of Bristol-Myers.
"To compete successfully you clearly have to have a critical mass around the world."

   The announcement follows by a day the completion of SmithKline Beckman Corp.'s combination with London's Beecham Group PLC, barely eclipsing their claim as the No. 2 drug maker and putting increased pressure on SmithKline Beecham PLC to deliver on the promised $600 million in cost savings and other benefits of their trans-Atlantic marriage.

   Other recent consolidations include Dow Chemical Co.'s planned combination with Marion Laboratories Inc. and Eastman Kodak Co.'s acquisition of Sterling Drug Inc. "Now more than ever it's size that matters," said David MacCallum, drug-industry analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist.

   Mr. Gelb and Richard M. Furlaud, his counterpart at Squibb, described the proposed merger as a "unique fit" of each company's research and marketing strengths, and a joining of organizations with remarkably similar cultures.
It would also unite Mr. Gelb and Mr. Furlaud, who have been friends since their daughters attended the same Manhattan school for girls 25 years ago.
The executives said the decision to merge resulted only from their own conversations and, despite recent Wall Street rumors, wasn't prompted by threats from any other company.

   Wall Street analysts generally liked the logic behind the combination, but some were unnerved by the price Bristol-Myers is paying.

   "Squibb shareholders should be thrilled silly," said Neil Sweig, drug-industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Bristol-Myers holders will suffer about a 15% dilution in earnings per share and should expect a difficult 12 to 24 months at least, he said.
Ronald Nordmann, a PaineWebber analyst, called it "a deal done for the next century."

   Under the agreement, Bristol-Myers would exchange on a tax-free basis 2.4 common shares for each of Squibb's 97 million common shares outstanding.
Bristol-Myers shares yesterday closed at $49.50, off $2.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
That means the value of the transaction to Squibb holders is $118.80 for each of their Squibb shares.

   Squibb stock, which had risen $3.375 a share Wednesday, soared an additional $24.75 yesterday, closing at $112.50 in Big Board trading.
The Squibb closing price reflects the belief of traders that the merger is a done deal and no one is likely to make a competing bid.
But in case another suitor does emerge, the companies agreed to a lockup arrangement entitling Bristol-Myers to purchase a 20% stake in Squibb for $123.90 a share, or $2.4 billion.

   The premium that Bristol-Myers is paying -- 35% over Squibb's closing price Wednesday of $87.75 a share, and even more over its $80 range before the company became the subject of takeover rumors in the past few days -- is unusually high for a tax-free stock swap.
The premiums paid in other recent big stock-swap proposals have ranged from 10% to 20%.
People familiar with the transaction attributed the high premium to Squibb's strength, and indicated that the price would reduce the chances that another company might try to make a higher bid.

   "If they {Bristol-Myers} wanted the company {Squibb}, that's what they had to pay," said a person close to Squibb.
"We could have done this deal with other companies."

   By structuring the transaction as a stock swap, Bristol-Myers will avoid adding to its books about $11 billion in good will that would have to be charged against earnings over the next 40 years.
Good will refers to the difference between the price paid for a company and the net book value of its assets.

   Mr. Gelb acknowledged the expected dilution of earnings per share.
"We very clearly are interested in coming out of dilution as fast as we can," he said.

   Mr. Gelb, 66 years old, would be chairman and chief executive officer of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Mr. Furlaud, 65, would be president and in charge of the new company's pharmaceutical business.

   Last year the companies had combined net income of $1.25 billion, on revenue of $8.6 billion, of which $4.2 billion was in pharmaceuticals.
Their research and development spending totaled $600 million, second world-wide in the industry to Merck, and they employed a total of 53,000 people.
Mr. Furlaud said that while ambitious hiring plans of both companies would be sharply curtailed as a result of the merger, he doesn't anticipate any layoffs.

   The merger addresses challenges facing the companies as they try to maintain their rates of growth.
Squibb has huge sales, about $1 billion a year, from its heart drug, Capoten, a treatment for hypertension and certain other types of cardiovascular disease.
But to sustain double-digit profit growth, Squibb has scurried to expand its research operations into new areas such as the treatment of brain-related disorders.

   But that will take years and tremendous capital.
Bristol-Myers can help provide those funds, plus research programs in areas such as cancer where Squibb is just beginning projects.

   "The cost of biomedical research is escalating at a rate double the rate of inflation," Mr. Furlaud said.
Drug companies can count on investing at least $50 million and about 10 years on each drug they develop that reaches the market, he added.

   Squibb officials concede that the company also is unable to marshal the marketing muscle to go up against Merck and other drug giants.
Company insiders say Squibb was speaking to Bristol-Myers in recent months, before the merger talks, about forming a joint venture to sell Squibb's experimental cholesterol-lowering drug, Pravachol, which is expected to be approved for marketing sometime next year.
The drug is similar to Merck's Mevacor, already on the market, and is believed to have huge sales potential.
But Squibb officials need Bristol-Myers to provide the resources to compete against Merck.

   Moreover, Bristol-Myers makes and sells a broad range of health-care and other consumer products, including such brand names as Bufferin, Excedrin, Miss Clairol, Windex and Drano.
Its presence in the over-the-counter drug market in particular, analysts say, will be significant as more drugs now dispensed only by prescription are marketed on drugstore shelves.
Finally, the merger fortifies Squibb, often rumored as a takeover target, against any attempts that would force it into unwanted alliances.

   For its part, Squibb gives Bristol-Myers basic research and future products in areas where Bristol-Myers has been a presence but has few new or exciting drugs.
For instance, Bristol-Myers's Questran cholesterol-lowering drug made the company the premier marketer of such medicines.
But it has been overtaken by Merck and Warner-Lambert Co., which have newer drugs.
Squibb's Pravachol would immediately restore Bristol-Myer's position as a major player in the anti-cholesterol market.

   Squibb, based in Princeton, N.J., has marketing and distribution operations overseas in markets that New York-based Bristol-Myers covets, company officials said.
There is little overlap in the companies' product lines world-wide or in geographical strength, analysts added.

   Messrs.
Gelb and Furlaud said the idea of merging evolved out of discussions of their industry's future that the two men have held over the past several years at Mr. Furlaud's apartment on Manhattan's Central Park South.

   "We saw problems of cost-containment {among health-care customers} and lots of things were in ferment," said Mr. Gelb.
"Ultimately we thought our companies would have to change."
Then, two weeks ago, over Mr. Gelb's Perrier and lime and Mr. Furlaud's scotch and soda, "We said, 'What if,'" Mr. Furlaud said.

   Negotiations began with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. advising Bristol-Myers and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. advising Squibb.

   Insiders at the companies said the deal was possible because Messrs.
Furlaud and Gelb have known each other for years and like and respect one another.
Both are widely respected at their companies as firm but benevolent administrators who put a lot of trust in managers who are aggressive and willing to take chances.

   In making the deal, Mr. Furlaud, who has been chief executive of Squibb since 1968, will relinquish his position as the longest-reigning chief executive in the industry.
The mantle will pass to Mr. Gelb, who has headed Bristol-Myers since 1972.

   The first indictments stemming from the government investigation of alleged futures trading fraud here are expected as early as next week, according to defense lawyers.

   Lawyers speculated that the government still hasn't determined how many traders to indict initially, although lawyers' estimates ranged from a total of 10 to more than 20 on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Subsequent rounds of indictments are expected, the lawyers say.

   Moreover, the Justice Department also could take the unprecedented step of naming entire futures trading pits as "racketeering enterprises" on the two exchanges, the lawyers said.
Identifying trading pits in this manner enables the government to bring fraud charges against traders in the pits under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO law, lawyers said.

   Since the government's investigation was first disclosed six months ago, an air of uncertainty has hung over the futures markets here -- with little word of any developments for several months.
But that may be about to change.
In recent days a flurry of contacts between prosecutors and defense attorneys suggests indictments may be imminent.

   "I'm getting ready for the sky to fall in next week," said one lawyer with several futures trading clients at both exchanges.
He and others stressed, however, that prosecutors haven't told them an exact date for the indictments.
And some attorneys still thought that the indictments could be weeks, rather than days, away.

   In fact, prosecutors could be ready to ask a grand jury for indictments and then hold off for several days or more if they thought a delay might induce traders who are targets of the investigation to cooperate.

   Bolstering the theory that RICO charges will be brought was the appearance in Chicago of Paul Coffey, a senior officer in the Justice Department's criminal division who must approve all RICO indictments.
Mr. Coffey is expected to meet here today with lawyers for traders who are targets of the investigation to hear their arguments as to why their clients shouldn't be hit with RICO charges.
Mr. Coffey, reached at the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago, wouldn't comment.

   Under RICO, the government can seek harsher penalties -- including the seizure of assets and profits earned via the alleged illicit pattern of activities -- than if it were charging traders with separate instances of fraud.
But by naming a trading pit as a racketeering enterprise, the government wouldn't be charging every trader in the pit with fraud.
Rather, it would allege that the traders it indicts used the pit as a vehicle for making fraudulent trades.

   Critics argue that the RICO law shouldn't be brought in many instances of alleged white collar crime, including futures trading fraud.

   It's highly unlikely the exchanges themselves would be implicated in any charges, lawyers said.
Both exchanges have said that the investigations on their floors appear to be limited to a relatively small number of their members.

   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas has declined to comment on all aspects of the two-year sting operation, in which federal agents posed as traders on both the Chicago Merc and the CBOT.
The government investigation of futures traders on the two Chicago exchanges surfaced in mid-January as government agents made late night appearances at the homes of dozens of futures traders to deliver subpoenas.

   Naming entire pits as RICO enterprises would do much more than tarnish the images of the exchanges, whose regulatory abilities have been questioned in light of the government investigation of trading on their floors.
Defense lawyers said it would mean that traders in a given pit could be indicted and tried together even if they didn't all trade with each other.
Although lawyers could be expected to move for separate trials for individual clients, defense lawyers said they'd have little chance of getting such motions approved.

   "They'd all be on trial together, and all tainted by the evidence against everybody else," said one defense attorney.

   Defense attorneys said they see Mr. Coffey's meetings here as a way for the government to avoid dealing with a stream of defense attorneys trekking to Washington for their clients.
Several attorneys said they had exercised their right to request a conference in advance of any decision by the department on whether to approve RICO charges.

   Defense attorneys said they plan to argue that it's inappropriate to charge their clients under the RICO statute.
But they admitted this would be difficult because the U.S. Attorney's office still hasn't told them its evidence or legal theories in the case.

   Indeed, some defense attorneys said they see the meeting as more of ploy by the government to show it at least listened to their arguments before pursuing indictments.
"Frankly, I think RICO is a 'fait accompli'," said one defense attorney with clients at both exchanges.
The initial indictments are seen as crucial to the government's overall case.
"Whether major undercover projects are viewed ultimately as a success or failure has nothing to do with how good the project is," former U.S. Attorney Dan Webb said in a recent interview.
"It has to do with whether you win or lose your first cases."

   Negotiations on cutting the capital-gains tax continued on Capitol Hill yesterday, but officials said no compromise was reached.

   In yesterday's talks, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) met with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Budget Director Richard Darman.

   Cutting the tax is a top priority of President Bush, but it is also anathema to Democratic leaders.
So while a capital-gains cut appears to have the support of a majority of the committee, House Democratic leaders continue to put obstacles in the way of such legislation.

   After yesterday's talks, Mr. Rostenkowski indicated that there hadn't been any progress.
Administration officials said talks will continue.

   House Democrats have suggested, as an alternative to cutting the tax rate on capital gains, reducing the taxable value of capital gains by an inflation index.
A possibility being widely discussed was applying to capital gains an index for inflation, plus one percentage point -- a suggestion that last evening was derided by top House Democrats as tantamount to a rate cut.

   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said yesterday there wasn't any need to rush things in the committee, and Chairman Rostenkowski hasn't scheduled the committee to meet again on the issue.

   In addition, Joe Moakley (D., Mass.), chairman of the House Rules Committee, said in an interview he "would not be inclined to allow" a vote on the House floor for a provision that cut the capital gains tax.
But he added he hadn't yet consulted with other House leaders.

   The House Budget Committee chairman, Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), said he had asked Rep. Rostenkowski to drop the section of his tax bill to which the capital-gains cut would be attached.
That would leave for a floor vote only the tax-increase and spending-cut parts of the bill intended to meet the requirements of the fiscal 1990 budget plan.
Extraneous and controversial provisions such as a cut in the capital gains tax, Rep. Panetta said, "jeopardize the chances" for passing the deficit-reduction bill, which is scheduled to come to a vote in September.

   In voting yesterday, the committee moved to make it harder to write off cellular telephones for tax purposes, and to use the additional revenue to reduce the taxes of the relatively few American companies that get all of their income from abroad.

   As part of an effort to ease the complexity of the corporate alternative minimum tax, the tax-writing panel adopted a foreign-income amendment by Rep. Guy Vander Jagt (R., Mich.).
The provision would permit companies that derive 100% of their income from foreign operations to use all of their available foreign tax credits to offset U.S. taxes under the minimum tax.
Current law allows only 90% of the usable credits as an offset.

   To pay for that change, Mr. Vander Jagt suggested, and the committee adopted by voice vote, a provision that would require cellular telephone owners to use their phones at least 50% of the time for business purposes in order to depreciate any of the expense.
Currently, a cellular phone user can depreciate any portion that is used for business purposes.
The provision wouldn't affect the deductibility of the cost of operating the increasingly popular mobile phones.

   Mr. Vander Jagt said he knew of only two companies that would benefit from the minimum tax change.
According to Kenneth Kies, a former Ways and Means staff member who now is a lobbyist, the two are Iron Ore Co. of Canada and Wabush Iron Ore Co.
"We assume there are others, but we don't know how many," he said.

   In contrast, at the end of last year there were 2.1 million subscribers to cellular telephone services, 85% for businesses.
By 1992, there are expected to be about four million subscribers.

   Asked about the panel's method of paying for the change on foreign income, Robert Maher, president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, said, "I would rather it had been done a different way."

   Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said he was convinced after three days of congressional hearings into ethical conduct and standards at the IRS that improvements need to be made at the agency.

   Testifying before the House Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee, Mr. Goldberg pledged to take a hard look at the way the agency investigates allegations of wrongdoing among its employees.
He said he has already recommended several changes to improve that "inspection" system.

   "It is clear that we can improve the inspection function, and we will improve the inspection function," said Mr. Goldberg, who became commissioner July 4.

   Mr. Goldberg ardently defended the overall integrity of the 120,000-employee IRS, which will collect over $1 trillion in taxes this year.
"These hearings have focused on several specific instances of bad judgment, misconduct and possible criminal wrongdoing," he said.
"They have not addressed the exemplary conduct and accomplishments of more than 120,000 dedicated, capable and honorable IRS employees."

   The hearings follow a yearlong investigation by the subcommittee focusing on eight cases of alleged misconduct by 25 IRS senior employees in offices across the country.
These include incidents in which high-level employees allegedly accepted gratuities and provided confidential tax information and one case in which an IRS official improperly intervened in a Justice Department examination as a favor to a friend.

   During three all-day subcommittee hearings, a number of current and former employees also told the panel they were intimidated and harassed by superiors after reporting misconduct by colleagues.
The subcommittee contends that the IRS was lax in investigating most of the cases.
In the first day of hearings, subcommittee investigators said only one of the individuals involved had been punished; IRS officials said many of them left the agency before the investigations were concluded.
IRS officials also said that most of the cases have been referred to the Justice Department.

   Meanwhile, Rep. Bill Alexander (D., Ark.) accused the IRS of blocking efforts to investigate an alleged drugs-for-arms operation between Mena, Ark., and Central America from 1984 to 1986.
Mr. Alexander said two congressional committees and law enforcement officials had sought access to William Duncan, then a veteran IRS agent who was investigating a money-laundering scheme linked to the alleged operation.
The lawmaker said the IRS wouldn't cooperate.

   Mr. Duncan, the agent, later told the lawmakers that he had received an unsubstantiated telephone tip involving possible bribery of a high government official connected to the case.
He said an IRS attorney told him to withhold that information when he was called to testify before Congress last year.
IRS officials disputed Mr. Duncan's claims, and the agent eventually did testify.
But he said the matter led him to quit the agency.

   Subcommittee members may push to increase oversight of the vast tax-collecting agency, possibly by transferring responsibility for some policing from the agency itself to the office of the Treasury Department's inspector general or by creating a separate IRS inspector general appointed by the president.

   But former IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs and Senior Deputy Commissioner Michael Murphy told the committee that would be a mistake.
Mr. Gibbs said having political appointees police the IRS could open the way for political manipulation and misuse such as that which occurred in the 1970s, when the Nixon administration used private tax information to go after political enemies.

   Mr. Goldberg said he had no opinion yet on the issue.

   Mr. Goldberg said the IRS is installing an improved computer system to investigate alleged abuses by employees.
The agency also plans to set up a hotline for employees to report misconduct directly to IRS headquarters in Washington rather than to inspectors in local offices who may be too close to the subjects they are supposed to investigate.
He also promised to review the training of inspection officials.

   Mr. Goldberg added, "I will not tolerate harassment of whistleblowers."

   Subcommittee members intend to continue their hearings in September.
And they seem to think the agency has a huge task ahead.

   After Mr. Murphy defended the agency's integrity and described the agency's successes in punishing wrongdoing, Rep. Doug Barnard (D., Ga.), the subcommittee chairman, angrily retorted, "The IRS world you describe, where wrongdoings are systematically punished and whistleblowers are applauded, is an IRS world I don't recognize, not from our investigations.

   "The real {IRS} world," the lawmaker added, "is where employees are afraid to come forward because of retaliation.
The real world of IRS is where if you're not a team player, you're off the team.
I do not agree with your characterization of the IRS one bit."

@  Homing In on Shared Down Payments

   Used to be, young couples who didn't have enough saved up for a down payment on a house would turn to their relatives for help.

   These days, total strangers are stepping in to provide the cash by investing in "shared-equity" mortgages.
In return for putting up some or all of the down payment for cash-strapped home buyers, the investors get to share in any increase in the value of the house, and sometimes additional fees, as well.

   Individual investors have been raking in big profits in the past two or three years with shared-equity mortgages in some parts of the country where housing prices have soared.

   Now brokers and mortgage companies are eagerly signing up additional investors to match up with prospective home buyers.
Two private limited partnerships have been launched to pool investors' money.

   But while some people have done well, shared-equity mortgages also present plenty of pitfalls.

   "Investors are betting on escalating home prices and the ability of their partners to make the monthly mortgage payments," says Michael Evans, chairman of Arthur Young &amp; Co.'s national real-estate advisory group.
"Real-estate prices don't go up forever, and in a slowing economy some people lose their jobs and can't make the mortgage payments.
You could get stuck with a house in a collapsing market."

   Shared-equity mortgages were popular in 1979 and 1980, when mortgage interest rates and housing prices both were skyhigh.
But the mortgages disappeared in 1982, when interest rates dropped.

   Today they've re-emerged as an answer to the severe affordability problem faced by hopeful home buyers in some of the country's hottest real-estate markets.
In Orange County, Calif., for instance, the price of a "no frills" entry-level home has climbed to $260,000.
"It's hard even for a couple making $60,000 a year each to save up enough for a down payment," says Mr. Evans.

   Many of the people investing in shared-equity mortgages are refugees from investing in rental apartments.
Elaine St. James, a Santa Barbara, Calif., investor who has purchased 10 equity-sharing mortgages, says she switched because she was "tired of hassles with tenants."

   Jesse Vint, a Herndon, Va., airline pilot, who has invested in four equity-sharing mortgages in the past 11 months, says his rental apartment investment was "a nightmare."
But he figures he'll get an annual return of about 24% on his shared-equity investments -- assuming the houses appreciate about 6% a year and none of the buyers default.
"I can't think of a better investment for me," he says.

   Whether a shared-equity mortgage actually is a good deal for an investor depends a lot on the local real-estate market.
"If you had a shared-equity mortgage in New Jersey, in the past 18 months you would have been killed as prices dropped 25%," says Stanley Zimmerman, president of the Mortgage Institute of California.
"Yet in Southern California, you would have done very well, since prices went up 30%."

   Moreover, just because a particular housing market has been booming doesn't mean investors can count on a continuing price surge.
For example, Mr. Zimmerman says he believes the fast inflation in California home prices is over.

   Even within markets, prices and prospects can vary greatly.
As a result, financial advisers say investors contemplating a shared-equity mortgage should carry their research down to the neighborhood where the house is located.

   It's mandatory that investors talk to their own accountants and attorneys before becoming involved, the advisers say.

   Each shared-equity mortgage should be examined carefully, because details of the arrangements differ.
Here are a few of the permutations:

   --Equitymaker Partners Ltd., Reston, Va., matches investors with home buyers.
The investor puts up a 10% down payment.
The buyer pays closing costs and other expenses, makes the monthly mortgage payments and pays for all home maintenance.
The buyer also gets all tax deductions from the home.

   The agreement lasts for three to five years.
At that time, either party can buy out the other, or the property will be sold to someone else.
After the amount of the down payment is returned to the investor, the mortgage is retired and the sales commission is paid, the investor and the person selling the house split the appreciation equally.
Officials of Equitymaker have also begun a "private" limited partnership (which is a partnership for a small group of wealthy individuals) to raise cash for more investments.

   --Executive Properties, Santa Barbara, sets up equity-sharing arrangements where the investor and the home buyer divide the down payment, closing costs and appreciation.
As part of the monthly mortgage payment, the buyer also pays the investor "rent."
This allows the investor to claim an income-tax deduction for depreciation.

   --CoEquity Corp., Costa Mesa, Calif., takes more of a debtor-creditor relationship with home buyers.
In its shared-equity arrangements, the investor puts up a 10% down payment and half of the closing costs, including CoEquity's 3% to 5% matchmaking fee.
The home buyer puts up the other half of the closing costs and fee, then pays interest at 12% a year to the investor.
The buyer gets all of the tax deductions.

   At the end of the agreement, which can last as long as seven years, the investor and the buyer split any appreciation equally.
CoEquity also has begun a private limited partnership to raise additional funds.

   David Toothill, a Santa Monica, Calif., software developer, has invested in 20 of the CoEquity shared-appreciation mortgages.
"I've been in the program for three years, and the returns have been phenomenal, but I don't expect this rate to continue indefinitely," he says.

   Mr. Toothill's investments also illustrate some potential problems.
Of his 20 owner-occupant partners, there have been two divorces.
One couple split after four months and the other after two years.
In the first case, CoEquity returned Mr. Toothill's money.
The second home is now on the market.

@ How Equity Sharing Works

   Here's the way an investor's return would be calculated on one type of equity-sharing agreement.
The example is based on the purchase of a $150,000 home, with the investor putting up a 10% down payment; the buyer pays closing costs and makes the payments on the $135,000 mortgage.
The example assumes that the house appreciates by 7% a year for five years and is then sold.
@Resale price of house after five years ......... $ 210,000
@Less remaining mortgage principal .............. -131,700
@Less costs of sale (8% of sales price) ......... - 16,800
@Total equity ................................... 61,500
@Less investor's down payment ................... - 15,000
@Total shared equity (to be split 50-50 between
@ investor and person selling the house) ...... 46,500
@Investor's profit (compound annual average
@ rate of return = 20.58%) .................... 23,250

   Crownx Inc. said it agreed to sell its Coronet Trust Co. unit to Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada.

   Crownx declined to indicate the value of the proposed transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, but Winston Ling, Crownx executive vice president of finance, said it is higher than Coronet's book value of about 30 million Canadian dollars ($25.3 million).

   Mr. Ling said Crownx was selling Coronet, a federally licensed Canadian trust company with assets of more than C$600 million, because it didn't fit in with Crownx's other financial-services businesses.
Crownx, of Toronto, has interests in life-insurance, financial-services and health-care concerns.

   Sun Life, also of Toronto, is a mutual-life-insurance company.

   Digital Equipment Corp., the world's second-largest computer maker, reported a 22% decline in net income for the fiscal fourth quarter and single-digit revenue growth for the first time since 1985.

   The results fell somewhat short of expectations, though analysts were cheered that they weren't worse.
"It wasn't a total disaster, so people are breathing a sigh of relief," said Jay P. Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

   Digital's weaker results follow a series of setbacks to mid-range computer makers.
Data General Corp., Prime Computer Inc. and Wang Laboratories Inc. all posted steep losses for their latest quarters.

   For the quarter ended July 1, Digital's profit fell to $313.2 million, or $2.51 a share, from $401 million, or $3.08 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 4.7% to $3.49 billion from $3.34 billion.

   Citing continued "lackluster conditions" in domestic markets, Maynard, Mass.-based Digital also warned that it "remains cautious" about the revenue outlook for the current quarter.
The uncertain outlook prompted some analysts to cut earnings estimates for the fiscal year that began July 2.

   Nevertheless, Digital's stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $92.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.

   Digital's president, Kenneth H. Olsen, said that while overseas revenue continued its double-digit growth, "business conditions in the U.S. are still somewhat slow, with fourth-quarter revenues similar to those of the same period a year ago, but up from the prior quarter."

   The revenue increase from the previous quarter "confirms that the decline in domestic revenues has bottomed out," said Carol E. Muratore, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
She said that recent increases in U.S. revenue reported by International Business Machines Corp. and by Tandem Computers Inc. "reverses the trend and shows that it's not just a bottomless pit."

   Marc G. Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc., New York, said that "if you dig below the surface, there's cause for concern."
He said Digital appeared to be expecting a slowdown in some European economies, where the company has long enjoyed strong sales growth.

   Mr. Schulman cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year to $8.25 from $9.
Dean Witter also lowered its estimate for the 1990 fiscal year to $8.70 from $9.

   For the full year, Digital's profit fell 18% to $1.07 billion, or $8.45 a share, from $1.31 billion, or $9.90 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 11% to $12.74 billion from $11.48 billion.

   Until the latest fiscal year, Digital had been the fastest-growing major computer maker.
The company had reported rapid growth in earnings and revenue from 1986 through 1988.

   Turbo Resources Ltd. said its board approved a shareholder rights plan intended to prevent anyone from gaining control of the company without making an offer to all shareholders.

   The Calgary, Alberta, oil refining and marketing company also said it plans a 1-for-5 reverse split of its common shares and to change its name to Canadian Turbo Inc.

   Turbo said the shareholder rights plan would be triggered if any party acquires 20.5% or more of its voting shares.
Other holders would then be permitted to buy additional shares at 50% of market value.
Turbo said the plan wouldn't be triggered if the acquirer made a bid for all the shares outstanding and the takeover was approved by a majority of the other holders at a special meeting.

   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Turbo closed at 68 Canadian cents (57 U.S. cents), down six Canadian cents.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. employees still refer to the auto maker's mass layoffs and near-bankruptcy of the early 1980s as the "dark days."
Just yesterday, though, things got pretty gloomy again.

   Chairman Lee Iacocca chose the quarterly meeting of his 600 top managers to break the bad news: Some 2,300 white-collar staffers -- 8% of the total salaried work force -- will lose their jobs in the next five months

   "The car and truck business in the U.S. is undergoing a dramatic and permanent transformation that puts enormous pressures on all manufacturers to get their programs and costs in line," Mr. Iacocca said late yesterday.
"This is not simply a reaction to the current sales environment."

   Indeed, what's hitting Chrysler employees isn't just the well-publicized car-sales slump of 1989.
So far, sales have dropped only 6.5% from 1988, the industry's second-best year.

   Instead, what really has auto makers scrambling is that sales are dropping just when car-making capacity in North America is soaring.
Though the first Japanese auto plant in the U.S. (Honda's) opened only six years ago, Japanese auto makers' U.S. production will reach one million cars and trucks this year.
That could triple within five years, and total North American capacity could hit 16.3 million cars and trucks, estimates Autofacts Inc. of Paoli, Pa.
Such increases would supply some 2.5 million vehicles more than likely demand -- equal to a full year's work for 10 assembly plants.

   For years, auto makers have seen this problem coming, but only now is it hitting home.
In the fourth quarter of this year, Detroit's Big Three will build 16% fewer cars than a year earlier.
And Japanese car production in the U.S. will surge 41%, Ward's Automotive Reports says.

   So Detroit faces the double-barreled blast: a cyclical slump and a structural upheaval likely to make the early 1990s almost as tumultuous as the early 1980s.
But the U.S. auto industry isn't dying.
Instead, it's increasingly moving into the hands of more effective managers -- the Japanese.
Even they, however, aren't immune to the forces hitting Detroit.
All auto makers, strong and weak alike, need to make fundamental changes.

   High on the list is leaner staffing.
Even before Chrysler's announcement yesterday, Saab-Scania of America had moved to cut its white-collar ranks 10%, some 55 people, through an early-retirement plan.
The company's U.S. sales are running 26% behind those of two years ago.

   On a vastly larger scale, General Motors Corp. is facing wrenching decisions about how many plants and employees it must sacrifice.
For nearly three years, GM has been on a corporate crash diet, shedding factories and workers alike.
But it's far from enough.
GM has repeatedly idled factories this year and seems to have four car-assembly plants more than it needs.

   (GM and Ford Motor Co. reported lower second-quarter earnings yesterday.
GM's net income fell 3.5% and Ford's 15%.)

   Even strong companies, such as Honda, must move aggressively to fix weak spots.
Honda's cars have been so well regarded that it has long disdained the rebates and other incentives to which lesser auto makers turn repeatedly.
But recently the car that sells itself saw its first sales discounts, and its dealers are scrambling to become salesmen instead of simply order takers.

   Despite the problems, the car business isn't all bleak.
Slump or no slump, buyers still snap up cars that are smartly designed and crisply executed.
One bit of evidence: Mazda Motor Co.'s hot little Miata MX-5, a sporty two-seat convertible with neo-classic styling and a modest ($13,800) base price that recalls the popular British MG and Triumph roadsters of two decades ago.
Increasingly, auto makers will be eyeing such niche products.

   Here's a look at the various ways auto makers will tackle the bumps ahead:

   Slimming Down

   Chrysler's latest cutbacks stem from a simple problem: When times got good, the company got fat.
In 1983, when the auto maker was still recovering from near-bankruptcy, it had some 20,000 white-collar workers, half as many as five years before.
But now, its white-collar ranks have ballooned to 31,000.

   Much of this was the by-product of Chrysler's 1987 acquisition of American Motors Corp. and its hot-selling Jeep line.
Chrysler also has expanded its finance operations.
However, Chrysler's world-wide sales in the first half of this year fell 10.5% from a year earlier, while its world-wide work force as of May was up 6% from the 1988 average.
At that rate, Chrysler could sell fewer than 16 vehicles per worker world-wide this year, compared with about 19 per worker in 1986.

   But as it slashes costs, Chrysler says it won't hobble product development, an area it can ill afford to cut.
The company simply hasn't had the resources to develop a broad array of state-of-the-art vehicles.
Its main subcompact car is 11 years old, and weak sales are keeping the plant that builds it on one shift.
Just yesterday, Chrysler doubled the rebates on those Omni and Horizon subcompacts to $1,500 -- a whopping 23% discount.
Such discounting put more pressure on its minivans and Jeeps to generate profit, but those lines are about to be bombarded by new competitors.

   So, Chrysler is looking for allies that can bolster its product lines.
Already, it has agreed to buy a low-cost midsized car from Korea's Hyundai Motor Co.
And it is negotiating with France's Regie Nationale des Usines Renault to jointly build a compact Jeep.

   GM's problem, meanwhile, is that it can build almost one million more cars in North America than it can sell.
Huge investments aren't earning their keep.
A prime example: GM's assembly plant in Doraville, Ga., which is producing barely half the cars it's capable of building.
In the early 1980s, the plant made cars for three different GM divisions.
If one division's model didn't sell, the plant kept running by building more of the other cars.

   Three years ago, that all changed.
Doraville was selected to build a new line of midsized coupes, code-named "GM-10" and costing $5 billion to develop.
The plant was outfitted with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of robots and other automated, flexible-production equipment.
But each of the four plants in the program was assigned to build just one division's model; Doraville got the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.
GM figured that that would improve quality, and it planned on selling enough of each model to keep all four plants humming.

   But last year, Oldsmobile sold just 116,000 Supremes, and this year's sales are running 6% behind even that lackluster pace.
GM is using barely half of Doraville's capacity of 260,000 cars a year.
The plant's robots and 4,000 workers have been idle for 12 of the first 27 weeks of this year.
The other plants in the GM-10 program are posting similar records.

   The one-plant, one-product strategy "is a terrible mistake in a market so volatile," says John Krafcik of the International Motor Vehicle Program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"These are billion-dollar plants, costing 30% to 40% more than a Japanese plant.
They've got a tremendous capacity to do two or three different models, but instead they focus on one."

   This mistake would have destroyed most auto makers.
GM is merely suffering -- and hunting for a cure.
It is adding four-door sedans to the GM-10 line.
It is converting two auto plants to truck production, closing a car plant in Framingham, Mass., this summer, and planning to squeeze production of one of its large-car lines into two assembly plants instead of three.
But industry analysts estimate that GM will have to close as many as four more plants to keep its pledge to use 100% of its assembly capacity by 1992.

   Shoring Up Weak Spots

   Because the auto industry's good times rolled on so long, each company assumed that when the crunch came, the other guy would get hurt.
That was especially true of Honda.
For years, while rivals dangled $1,500 rebates and interest-free loans before buyers, Honda stood above it all.
It effortlessly sold all the cars it could make in the U.S. and all it could ship from Japan.

   No longer.
In April, after its first-quarter sales slipped 6%, Honda gave dealers a modest allowance ranging from $100 to $300 a car.
This month, the company weighed in with more money.
Though still shunning direct rebates to consumers, it is offering dealers up to $500 for each Prelude and $350 for each Accord sedan.
They can use the money to cut their prices.

   "When demand exceeded supply, there was never any reason for incentives," says Thomas G. Elliott, executive vice president of Honda's U.S. sales arm.
Now, he concedes, "we have growing capacity, other manufacturers have growing capacity, and there are a lot of cars looking for homes."

   So Honda, despite all its strengths, must make more changes.
When demand seemed endless, Honda never had to fine-tune its distribution system.
Urban areas still get too many models equipped with manual transmissions, which drivers in stop-and-go traffic dislike.
Dealers in wide-open rural areas get too few manuals.
Dealers in cities where insurance is costly get too many racy CRX models, which draw high premiums.
Dealers would sometimes have to swap whole truckloads of cars to get models their customers wanted.

   "These are frustrating problems Honda has never encountered here before," says John J. Pohanka, a Washington, D.C., dealer who owns both Honda and GM franchises.
"But to keep up with the game, these issues have to be addressed."

   Indeed, Honda can ill afford to stumble in the U.S.
This fall, it will open its second assembly plant in Ohio and thus must buck a declining market to eventually raise its U.S. sales, including imports, from its current 800,000 cars a year to one million.
Much is riding on an all-new Accord, Honda's bread-and-butter car, which goes on sale this fall.

   Ford, like Honda, holds a strong position.
But after nearly six years without a factory shutdown, Ford has idled nine North American assembly plants so far this year for a total of 25 weeks.
So it recently scrapped one of its most ambitious projects ever: a new family of trucks and vans to be built on the same base chassis.
The projected $5 billion cost had dwarfed the $3.1 billion spent to develop the Taurus/Sable cars.

   "We're re-examining everything we said we'd do to see if we can do without some {new} cars or trucks," one Ford executive says.
"When you start earning less money and closing plants, you have to rethink your priorities."

   And despite its huge prosperity in recent years, Ford still lags behind Japanese auto makers in costs, quality and, especially, engine and transmission technology.
It is already spending billions of dollars on a crash catch-up effort.
That's why, despite cutting the truck program, Ford's automotive capital spending soared 55% in the 1989 second quarter.

   Seeking Niches

   For years, Mazda tried to get along in the U.S. as a discount version of Honda or Toyota.
Now, it has a new strategy: "Attack the market where it's weakest," says George McCabe, sales and marketing chief at Mazda's U.S. sales arm.

   Earlier this month, Mazda brought out the Miata MX-5, a car so popular that it's now commanding as much as $4,000 over the sticker price.
"It was a stroke of genius on Mazda's part," says Christopher Cedergren, an analyst at J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a market-research firm.

   It was also a stroke of luck.
In 1988, GM killed its similarly priced Pontiac Fiero, thus opening the market for inexpensive, sporty two-seaters.
Mazda's ability to exploit that opening illustrates how crucial manufacturing flexibility and market agility will be in the 1990s.

   GM killed the Fiero because it had dedicated a full-scale factory to producing the plastic-bodied car, and that plant couldn't run profitably when Fiero sales fell below 50,000 a year.
But Mazda expects to make money selling no more than 40,000 Miatas a year.
That's because Mazda builds the rear-wheel-drive Miata on the same Hiroshima assembly line as four other vehicles, including a front-wheel-drive subcompact and a minivan.

   Thus, Mazda now has a chance to sell an extra 40,000 cars a year.
One Pontiac official says with a sigh: "The Fiero could have been a Miata."

@  Making Changes
@  In DC-10 Design

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. disclosed that it's leaning toward making design changes to the DC-10, although it strenuously defended the aircraft's safety record.

   The acknowledgment came as the second DC-10 in eight days crashed, killing scores of people, and an airline passenger advocacy group petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration to consider grounding the fleet.

   The accident occurred early yesterday morning when a Korean Air tri-jet fell short of the airport in Tripoli, Libya, sending flaming wreckage cartwheeling through an olive grove.
The Associated Press reported last night that at least 82 people had died.

   Fog is believed to have played a part in the accident, which apparently has no connection to last week's DC-10 crash in Sioux City, Iowa.
In that disaster, in which 111 were killed, the engine in the plane's tail exploded, crippling key control lines.

   At a hastily convened news conference at its Douglas Aircaft unit here, company officials proudly reeled off a catalog of DC-10 statistics: 1,000 flights daily, more than seven billion miles in the air since July 1971, 745 million passengers carried by the aircraft.
They also stressed that until Sioux City, the DC-10 fleet had flown eight million flight hours without a fatal accident-longer than any other type of major airliner.

   But Dale Warren, a Douglas Aircraft vice president and engineer, said while it's too soon to tell what will happen to the DC10, the St. Louis-based company is prepared to make alterations if it's determined that they're needed.
"It would appear at this time, some action is appropriate," he said.

   Among the 10 or so options being considered: strengthening the casing of the engine, which is made by General Electric Co.; better insulating of the DC-10's three hydraulic systems, which provide pressure to move the flaps that steer the jet; and inserting special valves near the rear engine, which would shut and keep fluid in the hydraulic lines if they're severed.
In a front-page story earlier this week, this newspaper noted that the hydraulic systems on other planes have such valves, as well as other protections the DC-10 lacks.

   The last of 446 DC-10s was assembled earlier this year and is set to be delivered within the next few days to Nigeria Airways.
Thus, any modifications would be made to planes already in service.
The first MD-11, the three-engine successor to the DC-10, is set to be delivered in the fall of 1990, at the earliest.

   Analysts said if some design change is eventually undertaken, it probably wouldn't make much of a financial dent in McDonnell Douglas.
They pointed out that Boeing Co. tinkered with its 747 jumbo jet after a Japan Air Lines crash in 1985, with little effect on the bottom line.
"For companies this size," said Jerry Cantwell, of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., "it's nickles and dimes."

   Mr. Warren and Knick Knickerbocker, the company's chief of flight operations, emphasized that they consider the DC-10 a safe plane.
They said the engine failure that triggered last week's accident was unusually massive, adding that the hydraulic systems were damaged in three separate spots as much as eight feet apart.

   Mr. Warren especially took issue with contentions by the International Airline Passengers Association, a Washington-based organization, that the DC-10 has "inherent design flaws."
He termed the group's appeal to the FAA "unfortunate and distressing."

   A group including Unicorp Canada Corp. said it is raising its offer for all the shares of Steinberg Inc. it doesn't already own to about 1.26 billion Canadian dollars ($1.07 billion U.S.) from C$1.27 billion, setting the stage for a war of nerves with rival bidder Socanav Inc.

   The group, Oxdon Investments Inc., said it is increasing its offer for Steinberg Class A shares to C$53 from C$50 a share.
It said it doesn't plan to change its C$75-a-share offer for Steinberg common shares.
Steinberg family members and associates hold 87% of the common.

   Socanav, backed by the Quebec government's pension fund agency, Caisse de Depot et Placement, plans to offer C$75 for each Steinberg common share and C$51 for each Steinberg Class A share.
Steinberg, a Montreal real estate and food retailer, is about 20 times larger than Socanav, a small Montreal shipping concern.

   Socanav wouldn't comment on Oxdon's plan to raise its bid.
But a Caisse de Depot spokeswoman said Socanav will make its bid as planned at C$75 a common share and C$51 for each Class A share.

   Socanav holds an exclusive option to acquire a 52% voting stake in Steinberg from a Steinberg family group.
Socanav must make a bid of at least C$75 a common share and C$51 a Class A share by midnight July 31 to exercise the option.
A lawyer for the Steinberg family group wouldn't say if a higher offer by Socanav would void the option agreement.

   Oxdon could block Socanav from taking Steinberg private if it acquires enough shares to end up holding at least 33.3% of Steinberg's Class A stock.

   Steinberg's board conditionally recommended the original Oxdon bid in the absence of a firm Socanav bid or a higher competing bid.
Oxdon said because Steinberg's board supports a cash bid, it will offer only cash to holders.
Previously, it offered a choice of cash or securities.

   To finance the increased bid, Oxdon said its shareholders agreed to commit an additional C$250 million to the company.
Oxdon is owned equally by Unicorp Canada's Kingsbridge Capital Group unit, Oxford Development Group Inc. and Gordon Investment Corp., all of Toronto.

   Anchor Savings Bank said its fiscal fourth-quarter net loss widened sharply, largely because of the adverse impact of interest rates on its net interest yields, market losses on its high-yield security portfolio, and provisions for credit losses.

   The Hewlett, N.Y., thrift's loss widened to $26.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, from $14.8 million a year earlier.

   The company also said the quarter included charges associated with restructuring activities.
Nonperforming assets fell to 0.82% of total assets from 0.96% a year earlier.
The bank increased its allowance for credit losses to $20.1 million in the quarter from $17.9 million a year ago.

   "As a result of recent management actions and the recent decline in interest rates, gradual improvement is likely to continue," said James M. Large Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.
But "further negative one-time adjustments" may be necessary "as the restructuring continues."

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Anchor closed at $4.25 a share, down 12.5 cents.

   Armco Inc., buoyed from extraordinary gains from its joint venture, said second-quarter net income nearly doubled to $75.6 million, or 84 cents a share.

   In the year-earlier quarter, the steelmaker earned $39.7 million, or 43 cents a share, including a $15 million charge related to the discontinued insurance operations.
Quarter sales, however, fell 20% to $665.6 million from $826.7 million.

   The latest-quarter's results include gains of $112.3 million as a result of completing a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp. of Japan and $15 million from a favorable ruling on certain foreign-export commitments.
Earnings also included restructuring charges of $40.4 million and $45 million in charges related to Armco's discontinued insurance operations.

   Armco benefited from relatively strong demand for carbon, stainless and electrical steel through much of the second quarter, although the company said it noticed softening late in the period.
Armco said even though it "anticipates a seasonal slowdown in steel shipments for the third quarter, inventory reductions in the second half will reduce shipments further."

   Armco's carbon-steel segment recorded operating profit of $143 million on sales of $348.5 million, including the gain from the sale of 40% of the business and net assets of Eastern Steel Division to Kawasaki Steel.
Last year, that division had an operating profit of $50.1 million on sales of $504.6 million.

   Operating profit in the specialty-steels business dropped to $18.5 million from $23.7 million a year ago, as a result of production problems and lower prices for steel products.
Sales also dropped to $246.1 million from $254.8 million.

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Armco closed at $10.75 a share, down 37.5 cents.

   Fairfield Communities Inc., Little Rock, Ark., said it reached an agreement with Atlantic Group Inc. that prohibits Atlantic from buying more Fairfield stock and gives Atlantic access to confidential Fairfield information.

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Atlantic said it had discussed with Fairfield and other parties the possibility of a "business combination transaction" with Fairfield, a builder and developer of retirement and recreational communities.
Atlantic, a Jacksonville, Fla., retailer and distributor of natural foods and vitamins, said it wasn't certain a proposal would be made.

   Marcel Dumeny, Fairfield senior vice president, said he didn't know of any specific agreements or ventures under discussion by the companies.
He said the new agreement barred Atlantic and its affiliated investors, for two years, from increasing their holdings in Fairfield stock.

   An investor group including Atlantic, has owned about 18% of Fairfield's common since September 1988 when Atlantic said it was interested in acquiring a "substantial equity position" in Fairfield.

   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., Kirland, Wash., said Drexel Burnham Lambert will provide as much as $2.5 billion for McCaw's proposed acquisition of LIN Broadcasting Corp.

   McCaw said Drexel indicated in a letter it is "highly confident" that based on current conditions, it can arrange $2.5 billion of financing "either privately or publicly."
McCaw said the agreement with Drexel makes it confident it can complete financing "on a timely basis."

   In the testy relations between LIN and McCaw, New York-based LIN has expressed concern over McCaw's financing.
McCaw, the nation's largest cellular-phone concern, has offered $110 a share in cash for LIN, which holds valuable cellular franchises in several major cities.
The bid values LIN at about $5.96 billion.
LIN has rejected the offer as inadequate.

   Earlier this week, LIN set a July 31 deadline for completing a definitive agreement, and said it considers $127.50 a share a fair price.
McCaw responded to that yesterday in a letter to LIN Chairman Donald Pels, stating McCaw believes its $110-aashare offer is "full and fair."

   Salem Corp.'s management has declined to announce a shareholder meeting scheduled for next Monday, according to Edward Marshall, a Beverly Hills, Calif., real-estate developer and owner of 2.2% of Salem's 1.2 million common shares outstanding.
The Pittsburgh-based company makes heavy equipment for the metal and coal industries; the annual meeting was called by Mr. Marshall.

   "But a meeting will be held, anyway," Mr. Marshall said, adding: "There will at least be a meeting of concerned shareholders of Salem."

   As previously reported, Mr. Marshall exercised his right under Pennsylvania law to call an annual meeting of shareholders.
He said Salem has not had an annual shareholders' meeting since 1985.

   Mr. Marshall is trying to force Salem to buy out its chairman and chief executive officer, Miami investor Victor Posner, whom he contends "is not running the company in what you would call a normal manner."

   Salem's management has refused Mr. Marshall's request for a list of Salem's shareholders.

   American Electric Power Co. named five new operating-company presidents in what is believed the biggest management reshuffling in the company's 84-year history.
Triggering the changes are the retirements of several operating chiefs.

   The new appointees, averaging 47 years in age, include the youngest unit-president ever.
He is 36-year-old James M. Allison, who will become president and chief operating officer of Wheeling Power Co., effective Oct. 1.

   Mr. Allison, who has been South Bend, Ind., division manager of Indiana Michigan Power Co., succeeds Thomas R. McCaffrey, 50, who becomes president and chief operating officer of Columbus Southern Power Co. here, effective Oct. 1.
He succeeds William J. Lhota, 49, who has been named executive vice president, operations, for the AEP Service Corp. unit.

   Also named:

   --Joseph H. Vipperman, 48, who has been in the AEP Service Corp. position being assumed by Mr. Lhota, as president and chief operating officer of Appalachian Power Co., effective Jan. 1.
Mr. Vipperman, who will be executive vice president at Appalachian Power until he assumes the top spot there, succeeds John W. Vaughan, who is retiring Jan. 1 at age 65.

   --Richard C. Menge, 54, senior vice president of Indiana Michigan Power, who will become president and chief operating officer of the Fort Wayne, Ind., unit Oct. 1.
He succeeds William A. Black, who is retiring at 65.

   --Coulter R. Boyle III, 41, vice president at Kentucky Power Co since 1987, elevated to head the Ashland, Ky., unit beginning May 1, 1990.
He will succeed Robert E. Matthews, who will retire May 1 at 65.

   "We are fortunate to have been able to develop the management breadth needed in the 1990s," said AEP Chairman W.S. White Jr., 62, in announcing the changes.
AEP has eight operating companies.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, AEP closed at $30.125, up 12.5 cents.

   Alaska dropped its investigation into possible criminal wrongdoing by Exxon Corp. and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. in connection with the Valdez oil spill.

   Exxon and Alyeska, the consortium that operates the Trans-Alaska pipeline and its tanker-loading terminal, remain subjects of a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The state also is continuing its preparations for civil litigation and is expected to file soon a massive lawsuit against one or both of the companies.
But Larry Weeks, head of the Alaska state attorney office's criminal division, said the state concluded that it doesn't have the money or the statutes to justify a prolonged criminal probe.

   Last March 24, some 11 million gallons of oil spilled from the supertanker Exxon Valdez when it ran aground in Prince William Sound.

   Mr. Weeks said his office's preliminary investigation indicated that the most serious criminal charges the state was likely to bring against Exxon or Alyeska would have been misdemeanors under state law, punishable only by fines of as much as $100,000.
He said that federal laws that may apply to the same types of activities are felonies that carry fines of as much as triple the dollar amount of environmental damage.
To date, neither Exxon nor Alyeska has been charged with any criminal wrongdoing.

   "The costs of the investigation would have been enormous, and we didn't feel it would be worth it. . . .trying to get misdemeanor convictions," he said.
"The federal government has more resources and better laws that make it more appropriate for them to deal with any possible criminal violations," he added.

   Exxon declined to comment; Alyeska couldn't be reached for comment.
But some state officials saw the decision as a break for the companies.
Because of widespread outrage in Alaska over the spill and the companies' ineffective containment and clean-up efforts, some state officials say, Alaska might have been in a position to pursue the companies more aggressively for both civil and criminal damages.
They suggested that the federal government might be subject to political pressure to ease up somewhat in the interest of national energy policy.
"Exxon and the oil industry have many friends in Washington and not very many in Alaska anymore," said one state official.

   The state is still pursuing its criminal investigation of Joseph Hazlewood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez at the time it ran aground.
The state has charged Capt. Hazlewood with operating a vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge.
All the charges are misdemeanors.
Together, they carry maximum penalties of 27 months in jail and $11,000 in fines.
His trial is scheduled for October.

   A partnership owned by a Unicorp Canada Corp. merchant-banking unit and food retailer Cara Operations Ltd. said it extended its $43-a-share tender offer for Dunkin' Donuts' shares to midnight Aug. 11.

   Cara and Kingsbridge Capital Group, who formed DD Acquisition Corp. to make the bid, said they are awaiting a court decision in their challenge of Dunkin' Donuts' employee stock ownership plan and its stock issue to General Electric Capital Corp., a unit of General Electric Co.

   Dunkin' Donuts, which rejected the tender offer as inadequate, values it at $256 million.
In national over-the-counter trading, Dunkin' Donuts closed at $38 a share, down 12.5 cents.

   DD Acquisition said that at the close of business yesterday, 1,611,593 Dunkin' Donuts common shares, representing about 28.1% of the shares outstanding, had been tendered or committed to its offer.
Kingsbridge Capital currently owns about 15% of Dunkin' Donuts' common shares, excluding those tendered to its offer.

   Aluminum Co. of America, citing shortage of alumina because of a strike at its partially owned alumina refinery in Jamaica, said it will idle a 42,000-metric-ton-a-year potline at Wenatchee, Wa.

   The move accelerates Alcoa's plan to curtail aluminum production and is expected to add more upward pressure on the price of aluminum.

   The potline, which makes primary aluminum from alumina, is one of five at the plant, the Pittsburgh company said.
Aluminum products, such as beverage cans and foils, are made from primary aluminum.

   The action follows a walk-out Saturday by 600 workers at the Clarendon alumina refinery, a 50-50 partnership of Alcoa and the Jamaican government.
The refinery produces about 750,000 metric tons of alumina a year.

   Alcoa said primary aluminum production was being curtailed because of weakening demand for it, which has pushed aluminum-ingot prices down in the past several months.

   SPY BUSTERS stumble so far in efforts to crack the latest espionage case.

   The FBI's failure to arrest suspected Soviet spy Felix Bloch, or get a confession, could soon permit him to seek a court order ending surveillance, defense lawyers say.
No matter how the case comes out, the FBI faces questions about why the Soviets were able to warn Bloch of the inquiry, forcing it into the open.
A nagging worry: Was there another breach of U.S. security?

   The U.S. videotape of Bloch handing a briefcase to a KGB agent in Paris may not be enough evidence for a court case.
"It's not illegal to transfer a briefcase, even to a KGB agent," says lawyer Frank Warren Bennett, "unless it contains national security documents."
The U.S. still doesn't know what was inside.

   But "if Bloch was a spy, the Soviets weren't paying him just for the routine stuff he was authorized to have," says former Pentagon aide Richard Perle.

   POLITICAL TURMOIL in Japan jeopardizes chances to cut trade barriers.

   The U.S., which has a huge trade deficit with Japan, wants to focus coming talks on practices it complains keep out Americans.
These include bid-rigging, Japan's boycott of foreign goods, its distribution system and its government procurement policies.
But political uncertainty may make it hard for Tokyo to push through any concessions.

   The Japanese, for their part, want to discuss the U.S.'s low rate of savings and its budget deficit.
Bush administration officials hope the talks, which start late next month, will produce proposals from both sides by year's end.
But if the meetings bog down, Congress may press the administration to take more direct action against Japan.

   BUSH DISAPPEARS on the abortion ruling, despite his anti-abortion stance.

   The White House strategy is to avoid getting the president personally involved in the battle for state restrictions on abortion.
Officials don't want to offend younger pro-choice Republicans, especially women.
"I think his advisers are attempting to keep him away from a very divisive issue," says former Reagan aide Gary Bauer.

   Bush's silence raises questions about how deep his convictions are against abortion.
It is an issue that aides say he isn't comfortable with.
His reticence on abortion contrasts sharply with his calls for a constitutional amendment against flag burning.

   One aide seeks to put a positive spin on the silence by saying, straight-faced, Bush "feels so strongly" about abortion that he doesn't want to hurt the cause by seeming to interfere with the states.

   DRUG BATTLE: Drug-czar Bennett clashes with Justice Department officials who "think they're running the show" in setting anti-drug priorities, says an administration official, who adds that Bennett believes he is in charge.
Attorney General Thornburgh has said he is still the boss on drug-law enforcement.

   DEBORAH DEAN'S FILES at HUD show favors she received and those her former boss, secretary Samuel Pierce, got.
While ill, she received a teddy bear from developer Joseph Strauss, who reaped huge consulting fees on HUD projects.
And contrary to federal regulations, HUD kept a car for Pierce's exclusive use in New York.

   ADOPTION ADVOCATES plan to use the Supreme Court's decision limiting the right to abortion as leverage to seek new federal support for adoption.
A tax deduction to help cover adoption expenses is a priority.
GOP Rep. Smith of New Jersey sees political potential: "The Republicans need to be out in front on this."

   PARTING SHOT?
Customs Commissioner William von Raab, a Reagan-era holdover, may announce his departure as soon as Monday, and one colleague predicts, "He won't go quietly."
The outspoken customs chief has tangled with Treasury bosses from Bush's team.
Democratic Rep. Rangel urges Bush to keep von Raab because of his strong anti-drug stance.

   PROSECUTORS CLOSE IN on top targets in the Pentagon fraud investigation.

   The government is near to bringing cases against former Navy research chief Melvyn Paisley and consultant William Galvin.
Both men, who have denied wrongdoing, are major figures in the year-long procurement probe.
At least six major defense contractors also are under active scrutiny.
Unisys Corp. may agree to pay nearly $100 million to resolve its part of the scandal.

   The Justice Department shows no sign of reducing manpower for the investigation.
Lead prosecutor Henry Hudson and even some defense lawyers predict nearly 100 convictions.
There have been over 20 so far.
In the wake of the charges, the Pentagon has tightened contracting procedures and sharply restricted the use of consultants.

   The scandal may have scuttled hopes for any administration post for former Navy Secretary John Lehman, though he isn't under investigation.

   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposed fining a Transco Energy Co. unit $37 million for allegedly damaging archaeological sites in Alabama.

   FERC charged that the Transco unit, Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corp., failed to get necessary clearances before constructing its Mobile Bay pipeline system in 1987.
Natural-gas-transportation companies must submit information on an area's potential historic status before beginning construction.

   A Transco spokeswoman said the company intends to fight the proposed penalty.
She said Transco believes it had appropriate approvals, and has been assured it hasn't damaged any historic sites.
Transco has 30 days to respond.

   The commission said environmental consultants working for Transco surveyed the area for the pipeline and identified 77 archaeological sites.
But, FERC charged, Transco began construction before determining whether the sites were eligible for special status, as required.
It also alleged that Transco failed to get proper authorization from Alabama's historic preservation officer to build and operate the facilities.

   FERC alleges Transco damaged or destroyed at least 22 historic sites that are "at least in part within the right-of-way of the Mobile Bay pipeline."
It proposed "at this juncture" a $37 million civil penalty, though it said the maximum penalty allowed is $93 million.
A commission spokeswoman said a final determination will be made after the company answers the charges.

   Alabama Historic Commission representatives couldn't be reached for comment.

   House and Senate negotiators on the sweeping savings-and-loan bill set the stage for a test of wills with President Bush by rejecting his plan for financing the package, then approving the 1,000-page bill.

   How to raise $166 billion for closing sick savings-and-loan companies was the last major issue to be decided by the conferees on the landmark bill, which replenishes funds in the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., overhauls banking and thrift industry regulations, and requires S&amp;Ls to risk more of their own capital before FSLIC insurance bails out depositors at an insolvent institution.

   The compromise bill heads back to both chambers for final consideration next week, and could be on the president's desk by next Friday.

   After months of the stalemate and almost six hours of debate of the financing plan yesterday, the Senate conferees persuaded Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), the lone Democratic holdout, to adopt the House financing plan, largely in exchange for acceding to him in an earlier agreement to keep the nation's top thrift official in place.

   "I reluctantly support this motion," Sen. Cranston said.
"Otherwise I see everlasting impasse in this conference."

   Bush administration officials have vowed that such a move would prompt a veto recommendation, and yesterday Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Budget Director Richard Darman reiterated the message.
"We are pleased that the conference committee has finished work on the savings-and-loan legislation, which is generally an excellent product," Mr. Brady said.
"However, the administration position on financing is perfectly clear and remains unchanged."

   But President Bush may be hard pressed to summon a veto on a bill he unveiled in February as "emergency" legislation, and one in which the administration's plan prevailed in almost every other important issue.
"The bill has so much that the president wants, and it's so important for the country, it's hard to believe that he would veto it" because of the funding issue, said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), one of the proponents of the House financing plan.

   The primary purpose of the bill is to raise $50 billion that would be used to close or merge hundreds of insolvent savings-and-loan companies.
But how that money will be raised became a game of chicken between the administration and Democrats, who otherwise have largely backed the administration's tough positions.

   The administration plan would raise $50 billion using industry bonds, which wouldn't be included on the federal budget, and thus not increase the budget deficit.
The interest of more than $100 billion, to be paid mostly by the taxpayer, would be on the budget.
But using industry bonds would increase the cost by more than $5 billion over 30 years, because they would carry a higher interest rate than Treasury bonds.

   The House approved a plan to raise the money using Treasury bonds, and including the spending on the budget.
The ultimate costs are lower, but it would require a waiver of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, a precedent the administration viewed as the first step in eroding discipline in the budget.

   In a peculiar exchange, the fate of the financing plan hinged upon the close relationship between Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah) and his former aide, Danny Wall, now chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
House conferees, who had been intent on forcing Mr. Wall to again face confirmation by the Senate to keep his job, dropped their opposition in exchange for the on-budget vote.

   "I'm not the kind who makes deals," said House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), "but {several senators} said they could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn's insistence on Wall."
On Wednesday, Mr. Gonzalez paved the way for speedy approval of steps to protect Mr. Wall's job.

   Sen. Cranston, who voted for the administration plan in the Senate, also had reason to preserve Mr. Wall's job without reconfirmation hearings.
His confrontations with Mr. Wall over a now-insolvent California thrift would have undoubtedly come under scrutiny again in a hearing.

   Sen. Cranston proposed several compromises that would have put some of the money off-budget, but still violate the administration's proposal by requiring a Gramm-Rudman exemption.
In the end, he conceded.
"Deadlock is intolerable," he said.
"Delay is intolerable."

   Late last night, the conferees were finishing up provisions in the bill, including an attempt to strip the bill of special exemptions for certain institutions.

   Late last night, the conferees completed final provisions in the bill, including one to establish conflict-of-interest rules for employees of the Resolution Trust Corp., the huge new arm of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will oversee thrift closures and sales of their assets.

   The bill, which conferees hope the president will sign before the August recess, could still face hurdles, however.
The Senate could invoke a rule to require 60 votes for its passage, due to the Gramm-Rudman exemption.
Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) has said earlier that he would call for the rule.

   Key provisions of the bill include:

   --Minimum capital, or the cash cushion for thrifts, would be 1.5% of assets.
The greater the risk to a thrift's assets, the greater must be its capital base.

   --The Federal Home Loan Bank Board would become an arm of the Treasury.
Bank regulators and the Treasury would oversee the Resolution Trust Corp., which will sell or merge insolvent thrifts and their assets using $50 billion during the next three years.

   --Deposit insurance premiums would be raised for banks and thrifts.

   --Bank-holding companies would be permitted to acquire healthy thrifts immediately, which was prohibited under current law.

   --Investments in high-yield junk bonds and other risky activities would be prohibited or allowed only in separately capitalized affiliates.

   --Thrifts would be required to invest more in home mortgages.

   --Federal Home Loan Banks would be required to contribute a percentage of their earnings toward low-income homebuyers.

   USX Corp.'s USS unit and Camp-Hill Corp. agreed to operate jointly a now-idled tubular finishing facility in Houston to serve the oil pipeline market.

   The 50-50 partnership, named Delta Tubular Processing, is slated for operation by mid-August at a former processing plant recently acquired from Interlock Technologies Corp. and idle since last December.
Terms weren't disclosed.

   USX, a Pittsburgh steel, oil and gas concern, said annual finishing capability at the new plant is 100,000 tons for tubing and 150,000 tons for casing.
Under the partnership arrangement, Camp-Hill will staff and operate the facility, while USS will market the products.
The plant will initially hire about 50 workers but could ultimately employ 250 people.

@  Cost-Cutting Plan,
@  Boosts Rebates

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has launched an aggressive $1 billion cost-cutting program that includes plans for an 8% reduction in its white-collar ranks by the end of this year.

   The program takes effect immediately and will run through the end of 1990.
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca unveiled the measures to the auto maker's top managers at a meeting here yesterday.

   The moves come as the U.S. auto industry struggles to cope with a slowing economy and growing overcapacity -- the ability to build more vehicles than consumers want to buy.
To help deal with this in the short-term, Chrysler yesterday doubled rebates on six of its slowest-selling cars.
The midsized Eagle Premier, for example, now carries a $2,000 cash incentive instead of $1,000, and Omni and Horizon subcompacts now have a $1,500 rebate that amounts to nearly 25% off the base price.

   At a news conference, Bennett E. Bidwell, chairman of the Chrysler Motors unit, predicted that total U.S. car and truck sales in 1990 will fall to about 14.2 million vehicles from an estimated 14.7 million this year and almost 16 million in 1988.
Chrysler, with many aging models, is bearing a disproportionate share of the decline.

   But Mr. Iacocca emphasized in a prepared statement that the company's new program "will not be a one-shot deal" stemming solely from the industry's sales slump.
"The car and truck business in the U.S. is undergoing a dramatic and permanent transformation that puts enormous pressures on all manufacturers to get their programs and costs in line," he said.
"We must take the necessary steps to ensure our profitability."

   These steps include reducing salaried employment by about 2,300, or 8%, from Chrysler's total of roughly 30,000 white-collar workers by year-end.
Chrysler said it hopes to accomplish most of the cuts through early retirement or buy-outs.

   This cut, along with cuts in other personnel costs, including fringe benefits and overtime pay, would account for some $240 million of the $1 billion target, Mr. Bidwell said.
He added that the manpower reductions "will adversely impact" Chrysler's fourth-quarter earnings, but "if we do it right, the actions we're taking should go to the bottom line beginning in the first quarter of 1990."
He didn't elaborate.

   Chrysler announced its program after the market closed yesterday.
Chrysler stock fell $1.25 to $24.875 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.

   The cost-cutting program won't affect the No. 3 auto maker's long-range product plans, warranty programs or customer satisfaction efforts.
But it will include trimming purchased material costs, eliminating "internal inefficiencies" and "redundancies" and improving controls on product design and manufacturing costs in Chrysler's vehicle-making and selling operations, the company said.
Chrysler technical and financial-services subsidiaries will have their own cost-reduction programs beyond the $1 billion target for Chrysler Motors.

   To encourage managers to meet the cost-cutting goals, Chrysler is adopting an unusual incentive that allows the managers to "bet" on Chrysler's performance by automatically transferring 5% or 10% of their salary to a special escrow account.
Participants lose all their wager if Chrysler cuts less than $500 million during the course of the program.
If the cuts exceed that amount, participants would get payoffs ranging on a graduated scale from half their investment to double their investment if the $1 billion goal is met.
Participants get an additional payoff if Chrysler's stock price rises above $24.50 a share -- an average of recent prices -- by the end of the 1990, when the program and incentive are scheduled to end.

   Chrysler will offer the voluntary program to some 2,000 of its managers; all 29 of the top officers, including Mr. Bidwell and Mr. Iacocca, signed on at the 10% level, Mr. Bidwell said.

   Chrysler's new sales incentives are intended to ease overcrowding on the lots of dealers, who had an average 83-day supply of Omni and Horizon subcompacts and an 85-day supply of Premiers as of July 10.
A 60-day supply is considered normal.

   Other models that get doubled rebates include the Sundance and Shadow compacts, with new incentives of $1,500, and the Eagle Summit, with $1,000.
Chrysler also added a new $300 rebate on certain Colt three-door hatchbacks, and raised to $750 from $500 the rebate on some Colts with automatic transmissions.

   Empire of America Federal Savings Bank posted a $54.2 million net loss in the second quarter and warned that its shareholder equity for common stockholders would be wiped out by Sept. 30 if such losses persist.

   The nation's 17th-largest savings institution cited a marked decline in net interest income and a sharp increase in its provision for possible loan losses for the second-quarter loss, which included a $5.2 million reversal of a tax credit recognized in a prior quarter.
In the year-ago quarter, Empire posted a loss of $19.8 million.

   In the latest quarter, net interest income fell to $21.6 million, about half the $43.4 million of the year-earlier period.
The loan-loss provision increased to $40.1 million from $24.4 million a year ago and largely reflected growth in recent years of the bank's consumer-loan portfolio, particularly its VISA credit card and automobile-lending operations.
Empire recently completed the sale of $650 million, or about 90%, of its VISA portfolio.

   The second-period loss -- which followed a $3.1 million first-quarter profit and last year's $57.3 million net loss -- reduced Empire's total shareholders' equity to $104.6 million.
Kent Dixon, president and chief executive officer, said if Empire has another loss the size of the second-quarter deficit, the only shareholders' equity remaining at the end of the third quarter would be attributable to its preferred stock held by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.

   In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Empire's stock closed at $1, down 12.5 cents.

@  Help Assuage Some Recession Concerns

   The dollar was mixed after a report on second-quarter U.S. economic growth assuaged some recession concerns.

   Traders said the U.S. currency was also aided by technical factors when the dollar encountered buying interest at levels the market considered important.

   The preliminary estimate of the second-quarter gross national product showed moderate economic growth of 1.7%, in line with market expectations and a substantial slowdown from a revised 3.7% growth rate in the first quarter.

   While the decelerating economic activity reflected in the report continues to justify interest-rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and underscores the possibility of a recession, many traders said statistics on U.S. business-inventory levels dispelled worries of a sharp build-up entailing deep production cutbacks.

   "It looks like we're heading for the soft landing," said Garrett Glass, vice president of foreign exchange at First National Bank of Chicago.
With manufacturers relieved of additional pressure to reduce output, "that could help GNP {growth} to stay around 2% this quarter," he said.

   Also stimulating the dollar's rebound is the perception that the Fed, after letting the federal-funds rate drop a quarter point to a middling range of around 9% Wednesday, will stand pat on credit for the next several weeks.
Federal funds are overnight loans of reserves among Fed member banks.

   In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8782 marks, up from 1.8675 marks Wednesday, and at 139.26 yen, down from 140.02 yen.
The pound was at $1.6554, down from $1.6590.

   In trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar opened at 139.30 yen, down from 139.35 yen at the close there Thursday.

   Strong demand returned for the yen Thursday after its sharp fall on recent Japanese political concerns, boosting it against all major currencies.
The mark, which registered some of the strongest gains against the yen at the height of the concerns, slumped to 74.145 yen late Thursday in New York, well below 74.98 yen Wednesday.

   Traders said the yen was helped by the modest reverberations from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's defeat Sunday in a national election for half the seats in parliament's upper house.
The LDP has moved swiftly to find a safe replacement for embattled Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and to reform its image.

   Unless the LDP's struggle to jettison its scandal-ridden past appears to be failing, the yen should make further gains during the next few weeks as the market buys back short-yen positions and again focuses on investment opportunities in the strong Japanese economy, said Dan Brooks, chief foreign-exchange dealer at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York.

   While the yen made steady gains in Asian trading, the dollar held fast against other currencies.
When Europe took over the arena, activity diminished as participants awaited the U.S. GNP report.

   The dollar initially sank on the report's release as some participants sought to ignite a move on the low GNP growth, but the drive quickly lost momentum after running into a wave of dollar buyers around 1.8625 marks, which dealers termed an important level on charts.

   The inability to overcome buying interest and the positive aspects of the GNP report triggered short-covering by players who had sold the dollar during its recent slide and lifted the U.S. currency through the New York afternoon.

   The GNP report showed inventories grew at a $22 billion annual pace, down from a $24.5 billion rate in the first quarter.
Two important inflation measures released with the GNP, the implicit price deflator and the fixed-weight deflator, both reflected inflation levels in the quarter close to predictions, at 4.9% and 5.2% rates, respectively.

   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $373.70 an ounce, down $1.20.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.

   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $372.85 an ounce.

<HL> Bill to Bar Burning
@  Of Flag as Protest
@  Clears House Unit

   The House Judiciary Committee approved legislation designed to circumvent a Supreme Court ruling that prohibits states from punishing a person who burns the U.S. flag as a political protest.

   The 28-6 vote by which the proposed criminal statute was passed belies the partisan division created by the issue in the House.
It came after a sometimes raucous committee meeting in which Chairman Jack Brooks (D., Texas) blocked Republican efforts to substitute a constitutional amendment and committee Democrats defeated other GOP attempts to derail the measure.

   The full House is to consider the bill in mid-September, shortly after lawmakers return from a monthlong recess.
In the Senate, Democratic and GOP leaders have agreed to consider both a statute and a constitutional amendment in October.

   The Judiciary Committee's measure would make it a crime for anyone to "knowingly mutilate, deface, burn or trample upon" a flag, punishable by as long as one year in prison and an unspecified fine.
An exception would be made for disposing of a worn or soiled flag.

   Currently, federal law makes it a crime to "knowingly cast contempt" upon a flag by "publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling upon it" and provides penalties of as long as a year in prison and a fine of as much as $1,000.

   Last month, the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration.
The court said he was "engaging in political expression" that is protected by the First Amendment.
By dropping the phrase "cast contempt," proponents of the legislation believe it would avoid the court's objection by targeting an action rather the intent behind it.

   The committee-passed bill includes a provision calling for expedited judicial review of the statute, and Rep. Brooks vowed to introduce a constitutional amendment himself should it fall.

   House Republicans, along with President Bush, say only a constitutional amendment would protect the flag.
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu this week urged House GOP leaders to continue pressing the flag issue because he believes it could divide House Democrats, according to House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.).

   The Democratic leadership is more wary of tampering with the Bill of Rights and wants first to try a statutory remedy.
But Democrats also are angry and nervous over the way Mr. Bush used the flag to associate himself with patriotic values in last year's presidential campaign and are fearful of being driven in the same corner that Michael Dukakis found himself regarding the Pledge of Allegiance issue.

   House Democrats, including Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington and Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, jammed a small stage to face television cameras and praise the bill.
They also used the opportunity to fire a salvo in the battle of symbols.

   While Mr. Bush used the Iwo Jima Memorial as a backdrop when he called for a constitutional amendment, the lawmakers came armed with the flag that flew over the Capitol the day Pearl Harbor was bombed, in Rome after that city was liberated in World War II, and over the USS Missouri when Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's surrender.

   Raychem Corp., citing an unprofitable subsidiary and slimmer profit margins, said net income fell 75% in the fourth quarter ended June 30 on a 4.5% drop in revenue.

   The electronics concern said profit fell to $12.97 million, or 37 cents a share, from $52.80 million, or $1.52 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue fell to $300.81 million from $314.87 million.
Fiscal 1989 net fell 71% to $36.35 million on a 1.1% drop in revenue to $1.08 billion.

   The company attributed its lackluster bottom line to its Raynet subsidiary, which had a $15 million loss in the quarter and $55.07 million in the year.
Raynet, a relatively new unit that designs fiber-optics systems, had a loss because it is still developing products and markets, a spokesman said.
Raychem is seeking outside investment in the unit.

   Raychem also blamed slimmer profit margins caused by a shift in its sales away from military buyers to civilian aircraft and automobile customers, where profits are thinner.
The shift has caused factory overcapacity in some products, it said.

   Raychem's marginal effective tax rate -- 26% in fiscal 1988 -- climbed to 43% in the third quarter of 1989, which affected net income, the company said.
And a strengthening dollar cut profit on overseas sales, which make up about 60% of the company's revenue, it said.

   Raychem, which makes wires, cables and connectors for a broad range of industries, said it expects revenue to grow 5% to 10% in fiscal 1990.
Development outlays at Raynet will reduce fiscal 1990 pre-tax profit about $60 million, it said.

   Raychem's shares closed yesterday at $35.25, down 25 cents on New York Stock Exchange trading.

   The chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees financial markets raised the possibility of clamping down on stock-index futures activity if studies show traders are manipulating the indexes for their own benefit.

   Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.) made his comments in response to a Securities and Exchange Commission staff study that found a link between index arbitrage -- taking advantage of small differences between stock prices and futures prices -- and price volatility in the stock markets.
Mr. Markey has expressed concern that volatility is frightening small investors away from the markets.

   "Getting to the bottom of what creates the spread between the futures and the stock market should be a top priority for our market regulators," Mr. Markey said.
"If we find that the spreads are caused by inefficient market mechanics or manipulative trading practices, we will have to reassess the relationship between futures trading and the stock market."

   Limits on stock-index futures aren't likely soon.
But the SEC economics division said it was studying whether price differences are caused by "news or noise," that is, whether the markets are responding to legitimate economic data or not.

   Mr. Markey released the SEC staff report at a hearing at which some former brokers and exchange officials said they believe some manipulative practices -- such as "front-running," in which brokers use knowledge of coming customer orders in trading for their own account -- are common.
The SEC staff said it doesn't believe front-running is "widespread."
Subcommittee staff members said they planned to pursue the issue in hearings this fall with regulators and exchange officials.

   A unit of Neoax Inc. agreed to pay the government about $2.3 million to settle claims that the company submitted false information in connection with contracts to build radar equipment for F-15 fighter aircraft, the Justice Department said.

   The manufacturing company previously paid the government about $1 million in connection with the same alleged contract fraud, the department said.

   A spokesman for Neoax, based in Stamford, Conn., said, "The settlement will have no impact on Neoax's results of operations or financial condition."

   Neoax earlier voluntarily disclosed to the government that its Nuclear Automation Inc. unit had committed contract fraud between 1982 and 1986.

   The Justice Department said that Neoax's total payment of $3.3 million would resolve the company's potential liability for monetary damages and civil penalties.

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Neoax shares closed at $11.75, unchanged.

   SOVIET LAWMAKERS ADOPTED economic resolutions for the Baltics.

   The Supreme Soviet overwhelmingly approved two resolutions paving the way for Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to have greater control of their economies.
One measure would allow the three Baltic states to trade independently with the 12 other Soviet republics.
The other supports a draft law calling for economic independence by Jan. 1 for Estonia and Lithuania, which have declared themselves sovereign states.

   The parliament's action was considered a major victory for Baltic activists, who have accused Moscow of sapping the republics' natural resources.

   Bethlehem Steel Corp. said it will spend $300 million to build three new sheet-coating lines, increasing its sheet-coating capabilities by about 765,000 tons a year.

   The nation's second-largest steelmaker, after USX Corp., has a current coating capacity of more than one million tons, and said it will build a 72-inch galvanizing line at its Burns Harbor plant in Indiana designed primarily to serve the automotive market.
The project, scheduled for completion in 1992, will produce 450,000 tons of steel that can better accommodate paint and adhesive products.

   Bethlehem said it believes the automotive industry, while currently in a slump, will need "substantial additional tonnage" of so called hot-dip galvanized product by 1995 as car makers increasingly shift from cold-rolled sheet steel, which doesn't have the same corrosion protection as hot-dip products.

   A 48-inch line to make galvanized sheets for the non-automotive market will be built by 1992 at Bethlehem's Sparrows Point, Md., plant and replace some existing hot-dip capacity at that plant.
A third line, essentially a duplicate of the 48-inch Sparrows Point facility, will be built on an undisclosed site in the South or Southwest to serve the construction market.
Bethlehem said it expects the third line to be a joint venture with at least one other company.

   Bethlehem said the two lines will allow it to take advantage of expected growth in the light construction market.
The company expects to fund the capital improvements with debt financing.

   He used to dress up as Moses, let his "followers" come on stage to touch him, and expect them to do exactly as he said.

   This was no religious cult leader.
This was Joe Granville, stock market technician, news letter writer and showman extraordinaire.

   For a decade in the 1970s and early 1980s, his words moved in vestors to terror or elation.
In January 1981, for instance, he said to "sell everything," and a lot of investors did just that.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 24 points -- a huge loss at the time -- on record volume.

   Today, Joseph Granville's words mainly evoke snickers, in part because of his stubborn refusal to recognize the great bull market that started in August 1982.
It took him some four years to reverse his position, and by that time, his huge following was gone.

   But Mr. Granville's recommendations since the stock market crash have been right on target, and at age 65 he's trying to make a comeback.
"I want to spend the bulk of my remaining years teaching people how to use {the market indicators Mr. Granville has developed} so when I'm gone they will know how to do it themselves," he says.

   The man who quietly publishes his Granville Market Letter in Kansas City, Mo., seems far removed from the Joe Granville of a decade ago.

   At the height of his influence, Mr. Granville was a glitzy showman.
Chimpanzees romped on stage with him; laser lights blazed to entertain the crowds at his investment seminars.

   The man was "out of control," says New York money manager Jack Orben.
He "turned the profession into a burlesque," charges New Jersey money manager Kenneth Hackel.

   Mr. Granville's response: "I observed that when people are entertained they will retain more knowledge."

   Whatever the case, his followers loved him.
Even people who say Mr. Granville's advice cost them money still talk about him affectionately.

   John B. Olinger, a retired postal worker in Florida, used to subscribe to Mr. Granville's letter (now $250 a year) and paid extra for Mr. Granville's telephone early-warning service.
He says he felt he'd "finally hit on a secret formula to beat the stock market."

   Dutifully following Mr. Granville's advice, Mr. Olinger says, he sold all of his stocks in 1981.
In addition, he bought put options and sold stocks short, two tactics designed to make money when stock prices decline.

   "I lost over $100,000," Mr. Olinger says.
"It's taken me 10 years to gain back what I lost in just a few months by going with Joe Granville."

   So what does Mr. Olinger think about Joe Granville now?
"You can't help but like the guy," he says.
"He's a good talker.
His theory is real sound, and it makes a lot of sense.
Basically, it's a good theory.
The only trouble is, it doesn't work."

   Mr. Granville's method is a technical system that emphasizes trading volume when stock prices are rising compared with volume when stock prices are declining.
He also uses a wide variety of other gauges, many of which he devised or refined.

   Mark Hulbert, whose Hulbert Financial Digest estimates the performance investors would get by following newsletters' advice, figures that people who acted on Mr. Granville's recommendations lost 98% of their money from mid-1980 through the end of 1987.

   A week after the 1987 crash, however, Mr. Granville began what he hopes will be his comeback.
On Oct. 26, while almost everyone else was still scurrying for cover, Mr. Granville boldly proclaimed that people should buy stocks and hold them.
Ever since, defying occasional market dips, Mr. Granville has steadily reiterated his advice to buy.
So far, he has been right.

   Mr. Hulbert now ranks the Granville Market Letter first among some 110 investment newsletters for the first half of 1989.
Investors who followed Mr. Granville's advice would have gained an estimated 156%, he figures.

   As Mr. Granville rightly says, "No one else is even close."

   "My Oct. 26, 1987, call will probably be the best market call I ever made in my life, but to me it was the easiest call," Mr. Granville says.
"We had the most classical selling climax.
The public were scared out of their wits."

   Before long, Mr. Granville was looking at his charts and discerning an "ascending triangle" formation.
To him, it signaled that the market's recovery wouldn't stop until the Dow Jones Industrial Average hits 2840.
That's about 200 points above current levels.
He expects it to happen by Labor Day.

   He then expects a drop of 100 to 200 points.
"But further out I see tremendous things in 1990," he says.

   Recently, he has been advising subscribers to lighten their holdings by using "stop" orders, in which investors tell their brokers to sell if a stock drops below a specified threshold.
Mr. Granville says investors with gains should progressively raise their stops, but allow themselves to be "stopped out" when the market dips.
That way, he says, investors will have cash on hand to do some heavy buying around the end of the year.
In attempting his comeback, Mr. Granville has some strong boosters.
One is Michael Bronzino, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. commodity representative who tries to apply versions of Mr. Granville's techniques to commodity trading.
"He knows market history like no one I've spoken to before, and he knows human psychology," Mr. Bronzino says.

   When he tells other people that he consults with Joe Granville, "They think I'm out of my mind," Mr. Bronzino says.

   Mr. Granville still calls his subscribers "followers," but he won't say how many there are.
And he says his theatrics are behind him.
"That's completely out of my system."

   As much as he enjoys his new hot streak, Mr. Granville knows he has a long way to go to recapture his former prominence.
When major brokerage houses such as E.F. Hutton, Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch used to sponsor his seminars, he demanded guaranteed crowds of at least 1,500 people.
In June 1981, he packed New York's Carnegie Hall for a presentation in which he gave market guidance and played the piano.

   Last month, he came to New York for another seminar.
Only 14 people showed up, by Mr. Bronzino's count.
Mr. Granville doesn't quarrel with the number, but he says the seminar was "the most successful one I've given."

   "I don't measure success in terms of numbers.
I look at it as Chopin would, giving a teaching lesson to his pupils.
In time, if I keep calling the market the way I've been calling it, obviously the world will beat a path back to my door."

   The state of New Hampshire endorsed a revised offer by Northeast Utilities to acquire troubled Public Service Co. of New Hampshire for about $1.9 billion, but creditors of PS of New Hampshire said they consider the new proposal too low.

   Northeast's latest offer is the first of several reorganization plans expected to be proposed shortly in PS of New Hampshire's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.

   While Northeast could benefit from the state's support, any plan -- whether a purchase of the company or an internal reorganization -- must be approved by the court and creditors.
As a result, the state's backing doesn't guarantee success for Northeast's bid.

   Indeed, some creditors say they will oppose Northeast's proposal.
"This is not an adequate bid from our perspective," said Daniel Frank, a fund manager at Fidelity Investments, a giant mutual-fund company that is the largest holder of PS of New Hampshire unsecured debt and stock.
"We think the value of the company is well in excess of $2 billion."

   An internal reorganization plan supported by PS of New Hampshire officials is expected to be submitted soon.
In addition, New England Electric Service, which made an earlier proposal, said it will make a revised offer within the next month that will top Northeast's latest proposal.

   The pace of new car sales in Europe quickened in June against year-earlier levels, but even as the industry's boom hums along into its fourth year some observers see dark clouds down the road.

   While sales growth remained solid in southern Europe's biggest markets, gains were more modest in West Germany and Britain and sales actually declined throughout Scandinavia.
Analysts note that the gains in some places were probably the product of incentive programs.

   "The quality of sales is deteriorating," says Stephen Reitman, an industry analyst for Phillips &amp; Drew Ltd.
In West Germany and Britain in particular, auto makers are "fighting very hard for market share."

   Industry and government statistics from 12 countries, which normally account for about 94% of non-communist Europe's passenger car sales, indicated volume rose 6.8% in June from a year ago to 1,134,238 units.
The June figure also rose 0.6% fromMay.

   The rise in the latest month appears to confirm analysts' and industry projections that the upturn in auto sales is continuing.
It follows a slight 1.2% year-on-year decline in May but otherwise fits the 6.5% average growth rate for the year so far.

   In this Islamic republic, getting out the vote isn't a problem -- even when the winner of the election isn't in doubt.

   Voting here is a religious obligation as well as a civil one.
And with everybody over the age of 15 eligible to cast a ballot and voter turnout traditionally about 70%, election authorities are bracing for an estimated 17 million of Iran's 50 million population to take part in the presidential poll and constitutional referendum today.

   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini used to make a point of voting first thing on election day.
Pictures of the imam casting his ballot are almost as plentiful in the streets of Tehran as banners of parliamentary leader Hashemi Rafsanjani, the principal presidential candidate.

   Pictures of his opponent, Abbas Sheibani, aren't nearly so evident.
The parliamentarian and former agriculture minister is the only one of 78 would-be challengers to Mr. Rafsanjani not to be disqualified.
The others all were deemed unfit because they lacked sufficient political credentials or personal religious piety.

   Dr. Sheibani's political platform is almost indistinguishable from Mr. Rafsanjani's.
Both men, according to official biographies, stress their numerous terms of imprisonment under the shah -- Dr. Sheibani boasting 13 years in jail while Mr. Rafsanjani has to make do with five arrests that led to sentences ranging from 40 days to three years.
Both say they'll hold to a nonaligned foreign policy, and both stress economic reform and reconstruction as a priority.

   "There isn't any Western-style competition between us," Dr. Sheibani said in an interview with an Iranian newspaper.
One of his main reasons for running, he said, is that the Iranian parliament "isn't ready to lose such a good speaker" as Mr. Rafsanjani.

   Dr. Sheibani says he told would-be backers not to waste their money on campaigning for him but to donate their contributions instead to purchasing stationery for needy schoolchildren.
Mr. Rafsanjani apparently didn't give his backers similar advice, or if he did, they haven't heeded it.
Bazaaris, or merchants, have bought expensive front-page advertisements in the press urging a vote for Mr. Rafsanjani.
The less well-heeled students association issued a statement in his support.
And a group called "Hezbollah Youth from Qom" has brought out a poster showing the speaker in a diverse range of moods -- looking pensive and intellectual, and as a man of action, without clerical turban, heading off to the battlefield in military fatigues.

   But perhaps the real clincher for Mr. Rafsanjani is the endorsement he has received from the Khomeini family.
Both the late ayatollah's son Ahmad and a daughter, Zahra Mostafavi, have urged his election, praising both his management abilities and his loyalty to their father.

   Voters also are expected to endorse a referendum for constitutional reform that will consolidate the power of the presidency, making it possible for Mr. Rafsanjani to institute reforms virtualy unhindered.
However, the referendum stops short of abolishing the power of the leader of the Islamic republic to dismiss the president, so Mr. Rafsanjani will remain in office at the will of the Ayatollah Ali Khameini.

   The new partnership between American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Italtel S.p.A., although rich with the potential of combined strength, must be ready to fight to win a major slice of the European private telecommunications market, industry analysts say.

   Under terms of an operating agreement worked out between AT&amp;T and Italtel, the two partners have agreed to set up a joint-venture company for the distribution of private telecommunications equipment in Europe.

   The new company will focus initially on four markets -- Britain, Greece, Portugal and Spain, according to a confidential document obtained by Dow Jones International News Service.

   An Italtel spokeswoman in Milan declined to comment, and AT&amp;T officials in Rome couldn't be reached for comment.

   According to the document, AT&amp;T will own a majority stake, while Italtel Telematica SPA, Italtel's manufacturer of private telecommunications products, will own the rest of the joint venture, which doesn't have a name yet.

   The accord is the first concrete step resulting from a wide-ranging collaboration accord signed in June between the U.S. telecommunications giant and the Italian state-owned telecommunications equipment maker.
Italtel is a unit of Stet S.p.A., the state holding company for the telecommunications industry.
AT&amp;T acquired a 20% stake in Italtel as part of the June accord.

   "This is a very interesting deal, but you don't just walk into the European telecommunications market and find that everyone bows down to welcome you," says Richard Cunningham, telecommunications analyst with Citicorp Scrimgeour-Vickers in London.

   "AT&amp;T already tried once before with the Phillips (Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V.) joint venture, which failed.
It remains to be seen how they fare this time around," Mr. Cunningham said.
According to industry sources, the two companies are planning to acquire a series of small European companies that could distribute products already manufactured separately by AT&amp;T and Italtel.

   "There are a lot of companies who are going to be very anxious to send them {AT&amp;T and Italtel} back home packing," says Mr. Cunningham of Citicorp Scrimgeour-Vickers.

   Analysts agree that the toughest market targeted by AT&amp;T and Italtel is in the U.K., where intense competition between Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson and a joint venture formed by Britain's General Electric Co. PLC, which isn't related to the U.S. company, and Plessey Co. PLC, means only the most advanced products will be able to find a niche.

   In Spain, one of Europe's fastest-growing telecommunications markets, AT&amp;T has already managed to cull some phone-exchange contracts.
However, the AT&amp;T-Italtel venture will have to move quickly to build up its market share and "may have already missed the boat," one analyst said.

   The less advanced Greek and Portuguese markets have farther to go and lack a major supplier of telephone exchanges, but they are also largely dependent on European Community funding for such investments.

   As for public telecommunications equipment, Italtel's Linea UT switching system and AT&amp;T's ESS5 switch will be the core products to be marketed initially by a 50-50 joint venture that will be formed between Netherlands-based AT&amp;T Network Systems International and Italtel.

   In Italy, Italtel will continue to distribute the Linea UT switch, which will be beefed up with such AT&amp;T technology as toll-free dialing services and advanced transmission systems.

   In addition, the possibility of introducing the Linea UT to the U.S. market will be studied, according to the agreement.

   However, analysts described the two latter provisions as more "diplomatic" measures designed to reinforce Italtel's autonomy in the young partnership.

   Products assembled from parts made by both companies may be available as soon as next year, but industry experts aren't expecting a jointly developed product to hit the market until at least 1991.

   "What's going to be most interesting isn't the here-and-now, but what happens further down the road," says Dorian Foyil, telecommunications analyst for UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew in London.

   Adds Mr. Foyil: "They need to get used to each other and hone their products.
It remains to be seen whether or not the cooperation between AT&amp;T and Italtel really bears fruit."

   In the long term, analysts agree, the test for the new partnership will be whether it can develop and maintain the kind of state-of-the-art technology the market demands, and, simultaneously, move into the more advanced French and West German markets, where there already are major suppliers.

   Falling interest rates sent investors to the stock market in droves, and share prices finished generally higher in heavy trading.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit another post-crash high, rising 22.38 to 2635.43.
That left the average needing to rise just 87 points, or 3.3%, to pass its record close of 2722.42 set in August 1987.

   Yesterday's rally came after a government report said gross national product growth in the second quarter slowed to a 1.7% annual rate from a revised 3.7% in the first three months of the year.
Investors figure that slower growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to continue to lower interest rates gradually and keep the economy from falling into a recession.

   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange swelled to 213,680,000 shares, the highest since June 16, when 244,510,000 shares were traded in the latest quarterly "triple witching hour" session of futures and options expirations.

   Broader averages that reached all-time highs Wednesday made still more impressive gains yesterday.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 3.94 to 341.99 -- equivalent to a 30-point rise in the industrial average -- and the New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 2.08 to 190.22.
The Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 3.63 to 320.60.

   Traders said second-quarter earnings reports, merger news, asset allocation and stock-index arbitrage all played a role in yesterday's gains and volume.

   In the merger arena, Squibb soared 24 3/4 to 112 1/2 in Big Board trading of 3.4 million shares, and Bristol-Myers, the most active Big Board issue, dropped 2 3/8 to 49 1/2 on 4.5 million shares.
A merger agreement between the two calls for Bristol-Myers to exchange 2.4 common shares for each of Squibb's 97 million shares outstanding.
At yesterday's closing prices, Squibb holders would receive more than $118 of stock for each share held.

   Other drug stocks that rallied on the news and were actively traded included Upjohn, which went up 1 5/8 to 33; Pfizer, up 2 1/2 to 63 3/4; Eli Lilly, up 7/8 to 63 1/2, and Syntex, up 1 3/4 to 50.

   The product of an earlier industry merger, SmithKline Beecham, advanced 3/4 to 42 3/8 on 3.6 million shares.
Marion Laboratories, which has agreed to combine its operations with those of Dow Chemical's drug unit, rose 1/8 to 35 7/8.

   Stock-index arbitrage buy programs, in which traders sell index futures and buy the underlying stocks to profit from small, temporary price differences, kicked off the heavy trading in the morning.

   This was followed by a large amount of buying by asset allocators who juggle their investments among stocks, bonds and cash.
Falling interest rates generally prompt a switch out of cash and bonds into stocks.

   Kenneth Spence, technical analyst at Salomon Brothers, said money flows showed the huge amount of cash pouring into stocks yesterday.
He said $784 million flowed into the New York Stock Exchange, of which $634 million was in block trades.
That's bigger than most other recent flows and is regarded as a sign of a heavy cash commitment by large institutional accounts.

   Mark Donahoe, block trader for Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, said a number of technically oriented traders also jumped into the market.
He said stocks such as Anheuser Busch, United Telecom and Symbol Technologies appear to be breaking out of recent trading ranges on strong volume.

   Among stocks in the Dow Jones industrials, Merck rose 2 1/4 to 77 7/8, and Eastman Kodak, parent of Sterling Drug, rose 1 1/2 to 48 3/4.
Other standout gainers included American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which set a 52-week high, rallying 1 1/4 to 40 5/8 on 3.8 million shares; USX, which rose 1 1/2 to 36 5/8; and Primerica, which advanced 1 3/8 to 27 1/4.

   Security Pacific rose 1 1/8 to 51 1/2 on 4.2 million shares.
Activity related to the company's forthcoming quarterly dividend swelled volume in the stock; also, the company moved to forge closer ties with Japan's Mitsui Bank by signing a letter of intent to acquire a 20% stake in Mitsui's California subsidiary.

   Rumors that someone would soon disclose ownership of more than a 5% stake in Canadian Pacific helped send the stock up 3/4 to 22, a 52-week high, as 2.5 million shares changed hands.
Talk of a possible restructuring also contributed to the advance.

   Lyondell Petrochemical dropped 1/2 to 22 1/4 on 2.1 million shares.
Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate of 1989 earnings by 9%, based on "industry factors related to volume and margins," according to the company.

   Sterling Chemicals fell 5/8 to 9 3/8 in active trading after its earnings for the June quarter turned out to be well short of analysts' forecasts.
Other stocks hurt by disappointing quarterly results included Norsk Hydro, which went down 1 1/2 to 22; Great American Bank, down 2 1/4 to 10 1/2, and Allied Products, down 3 1/4 to 14 3/8.

   But Digital Equipment rose 7/8 to 92 3/8 even though earnings for the June quarter were on the low end of expectations and the company cautioned analysts that results for the fiscal year ending next June will depend on the U.S. economy's performance.

   In their first appearance on the S&amp;P 500, United Telecommunications Technology advanced 3 1/2 to 73 1/4 and Tyco Laboratories gained 2 to 44 7/8.
Typically, stocks new to the index attract buying interest from managers of index funds, portfolios designed to mirror the movements of a given market measure.

   The American Stock Exchange Index set another all-time high by gaining 2.57 to 375.35.
Volume totaled 14,790,000 shares.

   Healthcare International plummeted 2 1/8 to 1 3/4 after a management group's proposal for a leveraged buy-out collapsed.
Healthvest dropped 3 5/8 to 10 1/4; Healthcare International has a 9.8% stake in the partnership and would have spun it off to shareholders in the buy-out.

   Scientists at the National Insitutes of Health reported encouraging results from their trial of the drug DDI in patients with AIDS and severe AIDS-related complex.

   Publication of the report in the journal Science today comes shortly after the U.S. recorded its 100,000th case of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
More than half that number have died.

   The DDI study has become the focus of enormous hope and political activity.
The drug is seen as a potential boon to the 40% to 80% of AIDS patients who cannot tolerate the drug AZT, which is made by a unit of Wellcome PLC. AZT is the only antiviral drug approved for treatment of AIDS, but it can cause a severe anemia that can force patients to end the treatment.

   DDI, which was developed by the National Cancer Institute and licensed to Bristol-Myers Co., is a chemical cousin of AZT.
Both are classed as "nucleoside analogues," or false building blocks of DNA that insert themselves into the virus and interrupt its replication.
However, doctors haven't seen anything like AZT's toxicity in studies of DDI so far.

   The scientists said DDI was given for 42 weeks to 26 patients.
They noted evidence of improved immune function, including rises in both T4 and T8 lymphocytes, types of white blood cells involved in fighting infection.
The patients also showed decreases of 80% in their blood levels of virus and experienced mean weight gains of about 3.5 pounds.
More than half the group said their energy levels improved.
Patients at the highest dosage levels enjoyed the greatest improvements.

   Six patients in the study developed opportunistic infections, and one patient who started on the lowest dosage level died.
Side effects included rises in uric acid, mild headaches and insomnia.
Two out of a larger group of 45 developed pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas.
"This is a warning that this drug has to be treated with respect," said the paper's senior author, Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute.
"So far, it {hasn't limited use of DDI}.
But at higher doses or more chronic uses, it'll have to be watched."
He added that patients should avoid alcohol while taking DDI.

   The study, co-authored by Robert Yarchoan and colleagues at the cancer institute, was a phase-one study, designed to determine safety and dosage levels.

   As the phase-one trial has proceeded, DDI has become a rallying point for groups pressing for faster, broader distribution of experimental agents.
The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power negotiated with officials of Bristol-Myers to obtain a promise that DDI would be available to people who couldn't participate in clinical trials.

   Bristol management has said it will give the drug to patients in critical need even if they don't qualify for entry into a studies of more than 1,200 people that are scheduled to start in September, when scientists launch the second phase of clinical trials designed to determine whether DDI is effective.
Such programs have heightened urgency in view of the fact that bootleg DDI is being advertised for sale by mail-order entrepreneurs in Florida.

   Finally, the criteria for determining effectiveness are becoming a point of scientific and social debate.
In the AZT trial in 1986, an untreated control group suffered many more infections and deaths than the AZT group, thus proving the drug worked to preserve health and prolong life for some patients.
But increasingly some scientists and activists are questioning the harsh necessity of using death as the sole endpoint of a trial.

   Other factors short of death -- such as changes in T4 cells and in virus levels -- are being discussed as alternative criteria.
Such factors should be given weight, Dr. Broder asserted, along with reversal of AIDS dementia in adults and neurological problems in children.
But he added that "the jury is still out" on the question of whether such softer criteria are enough to secure the Food and Drug Administration's approval for DDI or for any other drug.

<TEXT>
   including 15 years as an employee of International Dairy Queen, and for the past three years, a "territory operator" -- I feel I am qualified to comment on the July 6 article "When Franchisees Go Their Own Way."

   While the tenor of the article seems to be one of portraying Dairy Queen as a group in turmoil made up of fractious people intent on doing things their own way, I must disagree, and from my perspective suggest that one of the great things about DQ is the willingness of both sides to listen and react to each other.
This ability to react has created a chain that is remarkably free of the "red ink" one sees in many of the chains listed in the article.
It seems as if one cannot pick up a trade publication these days without getting the latest tale of woe on chains that are retrenching, laying off, closing units, dealing with disgruntled franchisees or stockholders in the courts -- or just generally being involved in all kinds of nonproductive activity.
Fortunately at DQ, we who sit on the dealer councils are able to spend time on how we can improve the stores and listen and learn from each other.

   Finally, the comments of John Campbell are amusing.
I had an office two doors down from him when he was at International Dairy Queen, and am tempted to paraphrase the old saw: "He who can, does.
He who cannot, consults."

   Assets of the 467 money-market mutual funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute grew $1.85 billion, to $332.78 billion, during the week ended Wednesday.

   "Even though inflows of new money continued, the rate of increase has slowed markedly in recent weeks reflecting the gradual downward drift in short-term interest rates," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist of the Washington trade group.

   Institutional investors pulled $313.2 million out of 141 funds, during the week, dropping assets to $84.79 billion.
This was attributed to the "sharp mid-week narrowing of yield spreads on institutional funds over Treasury bills," said Mr. Dreyer.

   Individuals continued to add money to funds, however.
The 231 general-purpose funds the Institute tracks grew $554.8 million, to $105.96 billion, while 95 brokerdealer funds increased $1.6 billion, to $142.03 billion.

   Yields on money funds dropped again in the week ended Tuesday, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a newsletter.
For the first time since February, the average seven-day compounded yield fell below 9%.
The average fund pays 8.97%, down from 9.03% the week before.

   Having supplied your readers with a witty and insightful article on some developers' determination to leave their mark on history by erecting the world's tallest building (July 7), I hope you will follow up with an article examining an important corollary issue.
How will we ever get rid of such monstrosities when they reach the end of their useful lives?

   Even if the materials used to construct 100-story-plus buildings last forever -- which is doubtful -- it's unlikely that the design concepts on which they're based will prove equally long-lived.
If, as your article indicates, construction costs per square foot rise dramatically as building height soars, one can only imagine what happens to demolition costs.

   Additionally, ICN and certain of its subsidiaries may sell certain assets in the future, the SEC filing said.
ICN earlier announced that its board authorized the company to repurchase up to 10 million shares of its common, of which 6,513,389 had been purchased as of July 7.

   Rupert Murdoch's News America Publishing Inc. said it has ceased negotiations with Solomon Equities, developer of a Manhattan office building where Mr. Murdoch's company was considering leasing about one million square feet of space.

   The deal, in a 42-story office tower now under construction at 1585 Broadway just north of Times Square, would have been the biggest real estate transaction of the year in New York.

   A spokesman for News America said, "There was a letter of agreement signed by both principals, and the Murdoch organization was ready, willing and able to proceed.
Solomon indicated they were not prepared to proceed, and since that time, there have been no further discussions between Solomon Equities and News America."

   "Mr.
Solomon walked from the table," said Kenneth D. Laub, real estate broker for News America.
He added, "My client was amazed, after negotiating for six months in extraordinarily good faith, that the developer would change the terms and conditions of the deal."

   Mr. Solomon said his policy is not to comment on the progress of lease negotiations.
However, he did say he is talking to a number of prospective tenants, including News America.
He said 1585 Broadway is "a good product with good financing and I'm not worried or concerned about filling it."

   News America is the U.S. arm of Australia-based News Corp.
Its publications include TV Guide, Seventeen, Premier and New York magazines, the Boston Herald and the Star supermarket tabloid.

   The company, which operates out of several New York locations is planning to consolidate.
The firm is considering sites in New York and New Jersey, the spokesman said.
Another option would be to divide its approximately 1,200 employees between those locations.

   The aborted News America deal has attracted attention in the local real estate market for a number of reasons.
The high-profile tenant's space needs are substantially larger than those of most businesses in the city, and the deal would be twice the size of many deals that are considered big.

   Also, a News America lease on Manhattan's West Side would help fill a big block of the city's newly built office space.
It would be a boost to owners of half a dozen new, and still vacant, buildings nearby that couldn't accommodate the publishing concern but would like to have it as a neighbor.

   Individuals familiar with the talks say the deal hit a snag in recent weeks because Solomon was unable to secure permanent financing on the building given the proposed length and value of the Murdoch lease.

   A real estate developer will typically finance new building construction with a short-term construction loan at a relatively high interest rate.
Then, with a major tenant on board, the developer secures longer-term financing at a slightly lower interest rate from an insurance company, pension fund or foreign bank.
Then the initial loan is paid off.

   In theory, such financing should be obtainable for a fully leased Manhattan office building because there's more money available than there are quality properties in which to invest.
In reality, however, each side -- the developer, lender and possibly the tenant, as well -- can reach a dead end when they try to agree on how much equity each will retain in the building.

   Industry sources suggest that the proposed deal may have provided insufficient rental revenue to the developer to safely cover his debt service and operating expenses.
If so, lenders may have found the project too risky to finance and sought more equity to compensate for its risk.

   Mr. Solomon, however, denied that he is concerned about getting sufficient financing or attracting a tenant.
He said he has a seven-year construction loan on the property and points out that many top-notch tenants are currently in the market for newly constructed office space.

   Negotiations for the News America lease were complicated by the presence of another major tenant with claims to the property.
Last fall, the law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn signed a lease for 426,000 square feet smack in the middle of the 1.3 million square-foot building.
Many observers viewed that transaction as a coup for Solomon Equities, a young company headed by Mr. Solomon and his wife, Jean.
The couple had taken on considerable risk by building three Manhattan office buildings without prior tenant commitments.

   The arrival of another prestigious tenant, News America, seeking almost the entire building, provided an ironic twist; the law firm lease suddenly became more of a problem than a prize.

   Aside from negotiating with the developer, Murdoch representatives found themselves trying to cut a deal with the law firm to buy it out of its lease before it even moved into the building.
The firm is slated to move in sometime next year.
"They {News America} did approach us several times," said Herbert Weinstein, chairman of Proskauer's real estate department.
He describes those meetings as "very preliminary, but its clear they were willing to offer significant bucks."
He declined to put a dollar amount on the offer.

   The city's real estate brokers began buzzing about what it would mean to have the law firm back in the market and imagining how the pieces of the new puzzle would fit together.
To help Proskauer avoid realizing a capital gain on the sale of its lease, they reasoned, News America might take additional space elsewhere, then sublease the new space to Proskauer.
The law firm would in turn sublease its space in Solomon's building to News America.
But now the law firm is planning to move in next spring, and these other ideas remain scribbles on a napkin at a power lunch.

Succeeding him will be David Lawrence Jr., 47, publisher and chairman of the Detroit Free Press.
Robert J. Hall, 44, president of the Free Press, will succeed Mr. Lawrence.

   The Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal from an ad hoc Michigan citizens group opposed to the plan to operate jointly parts of the Free Press and Gannett Co.'s Detroit News.
Mr. Lawrence played a central role in guiding the Free Press through its planned operating agreement with the News.
James K. Batten, Knight-Ridders's president and chief executive officer, said Mr. Hall now "will be the leader the Free Press needs and deserves as we push to the end" of the Supreme Court's review.

   Mr. Capen will have responsibility for operations of Knight-Ridder's Business Information Services division and the company's cable-television operations, as well as assuming new responsibilities in the area of public affairs.

@  To Tell Public Products Are Recyclable

   The plastics industry is betting that a new marketing ploy will convince Americans that plastic food containers are recyclable and thus don't add to the nation's solid-waste crisis.

   Millions of plastic containers with funny little triangles molded into them are starting to show up on America's grocery shelves.
Inside the triangle, which generally appears at the bottom of the container, is a number from one to seven.
The number identifies the container's plastic resin or resins, thereby indicating whether it's a candidate for recycling.

   The industry claims that roughly 90% of all plastic bottles are either a one (for polyethylene terephlate, or PETE) or a two (for high density polyethylene, or HDPE).
Both are recyclable.

   So far, the ploy is working.
Seventeen states have incorporated part or all of the code into their state regulations.
As devised by the Society of Plastics Industry, a trade group, the code is intended to cover all bottles and jars of 16 ounces or more, plus other containers having at least an eight-ounce capacity.
Deadlines for implementation currently vary from Connecticut's Jan. 1, 1990, to Iowa's July 1, 1992.
The most populous state, California, has set a Jan. 1, 1992, deadline.

   Many big consumer-product concerns have adopted the code.
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., for instance, says 90% of its plastic containers now carry the code, although the Cincinnati-based concern adds that it will take another six to nine months to work off its pre-code inventory.
"There are products (in coded bottles) out there now, and you'll soon see a lot more," says a P&amp;G spokesman, rattling off such household staples as Tide, Cheer, Jif peanut butter and Crisco oil.

   In New York, Colgate-Palmolive Co. says its newly coded plastic bottles have started reaching stores.
Such familiar items as Fab and Dynamo 2 laundry detergent, and Palmolive and Ajax dishwashing liquid, are affected.
In Pittsburgh, meanwhile, H.J. Heinz Co. says it started turning out ketchup bottles bearing the code about six weeks ago; they'll be in supermarkets within eight weeks, a spokesman adds.

   Fast-food chains are gearing up, too.
That's not surprising given that fast-food packaging has been the focus of the bans that some 30 states and dozens of communities have either passed or have under consideration.
PepsiCo Inc.'s Kentucky Fried Chicken division, for example, says it will start coding its food containers and bucket lids sometime next year.

   Fast-food packaging, however, probably will remain a heated political issue.
That's because such packaging is made from polystyrene, which will carry a code number of six.
While a Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman acknowledges that polystyrene still isn't yet recyclable, he stresses that new technology is being developed and the company expects polystyrene to be recylable before 1995.

   Separately, motor oil sold by Du Pont Co.'s Conoco unit now carries the triangular marking, a reflection of giant Du Pont's fear of plastic bans.
"The public's distrust of our business threatens our industry," Nicholas Pappas, a Du Pont executive vice president, recently told an industry conference.
"We shouldn't let the environmentalists take the high ground," he said.
"We give a damn about the environment."

   PETE is what most soda bottles are made of, while HDPE is commonly used to make milk jugs.
Under the coding system, three is for vinyl, while four is for low-density polyethylene.
Five is for polypropylene, while six is for the dreaded polystyrene.
Seven, meanwhile, is simply for "other."

   One "other" that's been catching a lot of flak is Heinz's ketchup bottle, which contains 6% ethyl vinyl alcohol to prevent oxygen permeation.
While acknowledging that Heinz has been singled out for having a bottle that isn't readily recyclable, the company spokesman says that consumers are more interested in product freshness, and that Heinz has no current plans to change the bottle's formulation.

   The coding system is just one of a number of ways the plastics industry is fighting to keep plastic packaging from being banned.
Another is an industry-funded research program for developing products that use recycled plastic.
Park benches and flower pots are among the program's first successes.

<HL> Sears Tries to Update Image by Using

   As part of its strategy to remake its dowdy image by adding well-known brand names to its merchandise mix, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. has turned to the furniture floor.

   This fall, it will introduce a collection of 11 upholstered sofas and chairs that employ a high-tech seating-support material developed by Du Pont Corp.

   But Sears, Chicago, has taken on a tough sell: It will have to convince consumers that a woven fabric stretched across the furniture frame is as strong as the traditional springs, webbing and other upholstery innards it replaces.
Thus far, a few furniture makers have been willing to try the new material called Dymetrol that Du Pont brought out last year.

   "This is a breakthrough technology . . . but the furniture industry hasn't moved quickly on this," concedes Dan Schmierer, a manager at Du Pont.
"We think we can make it more visible through Sears."

   Even furniture makers who applaud the product admit that it isn't winning rave reviews among consumers.
For instance, John Bost, director of manufacturing at Carson's Inc., which has installed the fabric in about 10% of its sofas, love seats and chairs, says that "not only does it sit well-comfortable and firm, but it really is resilient. . . .
We're sold on it."
But Mr. Bost says his retail dealers are having trouble persauding consumers.

   The problem is that once shoppers remove the seat cushions and discover that there's nothing that looks sturdy supporting the furniture, they believe it is cheaply made.
"You still have to convince homeowners that this (Dymetrol) performs better than springs," Mr. Bost says.

   Industry experts also say that Sears, which of late has been stressing its "everyday low prices," may be hindered in its ability to sell its line, which it has positioned as more fashionable and more expensive than the typical furniture it sells.
For example, a three-piece sectional couch is about $1,700.
Sears' typical sectional couches sell in the $1,000 to $1,400 range.

   Despite the challenges, Sears dominance in selling furniture -- its annual furniture sales are estimated at more than $1 billion -- is such that analysts say the nation's biggest retailer is well-poised to win over skeptical consumers.
"Sears has the clout and the credibility when it comes to furniture," says Jerry Epperson, a securities analyst at Wheat First Securities.

   Sears and Du Pont introduced the Lasting Images furniture line at the American Craft Museum here in a model living room similar to the ones that will be set up this fall in 450 of Sears' larger stores.

   To help explain the product, Sears will install television monitors playing videotapes which show a man poking slits through the furniture fabric with a knife.
The demonstrator then jumps up and down on the furniture to illustrate Du Pont's claims that the woven product is "six times more durable than typical spring construction."

   Palmer Financial Corp., controlled by Tampa investor Hugh F. Culverhouse, said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board approved its application to acquire Coast Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Sarasota, Fla.

   The company said the Bank Board's approval is subject to certain conditions, which Palmer Financial and Mr. Culverhouse are reviewing.
A decision on Palmer's ability to comply with the conditions will be made on or before next Monday, the company said.

   Mr. Culverhouse called off a previous $20-a-share, or $71.9 million, merger pact with Coast Federal in November, citing conditions required by the Bank Board to approve the transaction.

   He returned earlier this year with a lower, hostile tender offer of $60 million, or $15 a share, which Coast Federal has been trying to fend off.

   In February, Coast sued Mr. Culverhouse to halt the tender offer by alleging that he and Palmer violated securities laws through a series of misrepresentations and omissions in its tender offer disclosure materials.
But Palmer said it already has more of the company's stock than it needs to complete the tender offer.
